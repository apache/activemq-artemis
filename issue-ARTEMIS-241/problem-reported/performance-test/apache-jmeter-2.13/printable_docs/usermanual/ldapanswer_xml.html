    The extended LDAP sampler was built to support testing for very complex testpurposes.
    It was aimed at supporting the LDAP operations as close as possible.
    As the results are not passed back in a user-readable form, I invented my own xml definition to 
    construct an answer in xml encoding, so the results may be parsed with regextracter or alike functions.
