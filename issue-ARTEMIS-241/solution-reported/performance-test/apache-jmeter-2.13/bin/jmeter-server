##   To change the RMI/Server port:
##
##   SERVER_PORT=1234 jmeter-server
##

DIRNAME=`dirname $0`

# If the client fails with:
# ERROR - jmeter.engine.ClientJMeterEngine: java.rmi.ConnectException: Connection refused to host: 127.0.0.1
# then it may be due to the server host returning 127.0.0.1 as its address 

# One way to fix this is to define RMI_HOST_DEF below
#RMI_HOST_DEF=-Djava.rmi.server.hostname=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx

${DIRNAME}/jmeter ${RMI_HOST_DEF} -Dserver_port=${SERVER_PORT:-1099} -s -j jmeter-server.log "$@"
