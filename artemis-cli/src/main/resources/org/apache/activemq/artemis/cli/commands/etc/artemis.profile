# Logs Safepoints JVM pauses: Uncomment to enable them
# In addition to the traditional GC logs you could enable some JVM flags to know any meaningful and "hidden" pause that could
# affect the latencies of the services delivered by the broker, including those that are not reported by the classic GC logs
# and dependent by JVM background work (eg method deoptimizations, lock unbiasing, JNI, counted loops and obviously GC activity).
# Replace "all_pauses.log" with the file name you want to log to.
