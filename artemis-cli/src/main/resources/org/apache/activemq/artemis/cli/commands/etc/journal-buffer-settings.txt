       This value was determined through a calculation.
       Your system could perform ${writesPerMillisecond} writes per millisecond
       on the current journal configuration.
       That translates as a sync write every ${nanoseconds} nanoseconds.

       Note: If you specify 0 the system will perform writes directly to the disk.
             We recommend this to be 0 if you are using journalType=MAPPED and journal-datasync=false.
