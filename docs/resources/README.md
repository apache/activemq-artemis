## Font Awesome

By default AsciiDoctor generates output which links to remote resources for Font Awesome.
However, Apache guidelines insist we host these resources *locally*.
We're currently using [Font Awesome 4.7.0](https://fontawesome.com/v4/get-started/).
See [these instructions](https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoctor/latest/html-backend/local-font-awesome/) for additional details.
