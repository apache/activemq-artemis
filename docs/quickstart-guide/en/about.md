About ActiveMQ
==============

What is ActiveMQ?

-   ActiveMQ is an open source project to build a multi-protocol,
    embeddable, very high performance, clustered, asynchronous messaging
    system.

-   For answers to more questions about what ActiveMQ is and what it
    isn't please visit the [FAQs wiki
    page](http://www.jboss.org/community/wiki/ActiveMQGeneralFAQs).

Why use ActiveMQ? Here are just a few of the reasons:

-   100% open source software. ActiveMQ is licenced using the Apache
    Software License v2.0 to minimise barriers to adoption.

-   ActiveMQ is designed with usability in mind.

-   Written in Java. Runs on any platform with a Java 6+ runtime, that's
    everything from Windows desktops to IBM mainframes.

-   Amazing performance. Our class beating high performance journal
    provides persistent messaging performance at rates normally seen for
    non persistent messaging, our non persistent messaging performance
    rocks the boat too.

-   Full feature set. All the features you'd expect in any serious
    messaging system, and others you won't find anywhere else.

-   Elegant, clean-cut design with minimal third party dependencies. Run
    ActiveMQ stand-alone, run it in integrated in your favourite JEE
    application server, or run it embedded inside your own product. It's
    up to you.

-   Seamless high availability. We provide a HA solution with automatic
    client failover so you can guarantee zero message loss or
    duplication in event of server failure.

-   Hugely flexible clustering. Create clusters of servers that know how
    to load balance messages. Link geographically distributed clusters
    over unreliable connections to form a global network. Configure
    routing of messages in a highly flexible way.
