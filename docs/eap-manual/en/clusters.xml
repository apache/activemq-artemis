   <title>ActiveMQ and EAP Cluster Configuration</title>
   <section>
      <title>Configuring Failover</title>
      <para>
         This chapter explains how to configure ActiveMQ within EAP with live backup-groups. Currently in this version
         ActiveMQ only supports shared store for backup nodes so we assume that in the rest of this chapter.
      </para>
      <para>There are 2 main ways to configure ActiveMQ servers to have a backup server:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
         <listitem>
            <para>Colocated. This is when an EAP instance has both a live and backup(s) running.</para>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <para>Dedicated. This is when an EAP instance has either a live or backup running but never both.</para>
         </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <section>
         <title>Colocated Live and Backup in Symmetrical cluster</title>
         <para>
            The colocated symmetrical topology will be the most widely used topology, this is where an EAP instance has
            a live node running plus 1 or more backup node. Each backup node will belong to a live node on another EAP
            instance. In a simple cluster of 2
            EAP instances this would mean that each EAP instance would have a live server and 1 backup server as in
            diagram1.
         </para>
         <para>
            <graphic fileref="images/simple-colocated.jpg" align="center" format="jpg" scale="30"/>
         </para>
         <para>
            Here the continuous lines show before failover and the dotted lines show the state of the cluster after
            failover has occurred. To start with the 2 live servers are connected forming a cluster with each live server
            connected to its local applications (via JCA). Also remote clients are connected to the live servers. After
            failover the backup connects to the still available live server (which happens to be in the same vm) and takes
            over as the live server in the cluster. Any remote clients also failover.
         </para>
         <para>
            One thing to mention is that in that depending on what consumers/producers and MDB's etc are available messages
            will be distributed between the nodes to make sure that all clients are satisfied from a JMS perspective. That is
            if a producer is sending messages to a queue on a backup server that has no consumers, the messages will be
            distributed to a live node elsewhere.
         </para>
         <para>
            The following diagram is slightly more complex but shows the same configuration with 3 servers. Note that the
            cluster connections ave been removed to make the configuration clearer but in reality all live servers will
            form a cluster.
         </para>
         <para>
            <graphic fileref="images/simple-colocated2.jpg" align="center" format="jpg" scale="30"/>
         </para>
         <para>
            With more than 2 servers it is up to the user as to how many backups per live server are configured, you can
            have
            as many backups as required but usually 1 would suffice. In 3 node topology you may have each EAP instance
            configured
            with 2 backups in a 4 node 3 backups and so on. The following diagram demonstrates this.
         </para>

         </para>

            <title>Configuration</title>
            <section>
               <title>Live Server Configuration</title>
               <para>
                  First let's start with the configuration of the live server, we will use the EAP 'all' configuration as
                  our starting point. Since this version only supports shared store for failover we need to configure
                  this in the
                  <literal>activemq-configuration.xml</literal>
                  file like so:
               </para>
               <programlisting>
                  &lt;shared-store>true&lt;/shared-store>
               </programlisting>
               <para>
                  Obviously this means that the location of the journal files etc will have to be configured to be some
                  where
                  where
                  this lives backup can access. You may change the lives configuration in
                  <literal>activemq-configuration.xml</literal>
                  to
                  something like:
               </para>
               <programlisting>
   &lt;large-messages-directory>/media/shared/data/large-messages&lt;/large-messages-directory>
   &lt;bindings-directory>/media/shared/data/bindings&lt;/bindings-directory>
   &lt;journal-directory>/media/shared/data/journal&lt;/journal-directory>
   &lt;paging-directory>/media/shared/data/paging&lt;/paging-directory>
               </programlisting>
               <para>
                  How these paths are configured will of course depend on your network settings or file system.
               </para>
               <para>
                  Now we need to configure how remote JMS clients will behave if the server is shutdown in a normal
                  fashion.
                  By
                  default
                  Clients will not failover if the live server is shutdown. Depending on there connection factory
                  settings
                  they will either fail or try to reconnect to the live server.
               </para>
               <para>If you want clients to failover on a normal server shutdown the you must configure the
                  <literal>failover-on-shutdown</literal>
                  flag to true in the
                  <literal>activemq-configuration.xml</literal>
                  file like so:
               </para>
               <programlisting>
   &lt;failover-on-shutdown>false&lt;/failover-on-shutdown>
               </programlisting>
               <para>Don't worry if you have this set to false (which is the default) but still want failover to occur,
                  simply
                  kill
                  the
                  server process directly or call
                  <literal>forceFailover</literal>
                  via jmx or the admin console on the core server object.
               </para>
               <para>We also need to configure the connection factories used by the client to be HA. This is done by
                  adding
                  certain attributes to the connection factories in<literal>activemq-jms.xml</literal>. Let's look at an
                  example:
               </para>
               <programlisting>
   &lt;connection-factory name="NettyConnectionFactory">
      &lt;xa>true&lt;/xa>
      &lt;connectors>
         &lt;connector-ref connector-name="netty"/>
      &lt;/connectors>
      &lt;entries>
         &lt;entry name="/ConnectionFactory"/>
         &lt;entry name="/XAConnectionFactory"/>
      &lt;/entries>

      &lt;ha>true&lt;/ha>
      &lt;!-- Pause 1 second between connect attempts -->
      &lt;retry-interval>1000&lt;/retry-interval>

      &lt;!-- Multiply subsequent reconnect pauses by this multiplier. This can be used to
      implement an exponential back-off. For our purposes we just set to 1.0 so each reconnect
      pause is the same length -->
      &lt;retry-interval-multiplier>1.0&lt;/retry-interval-multiplier>

      &lt;!-- Try reconnecting an unlimited number of times (-1 means "unlimited") -->
      &lt;reconnect-attempts>-1&lt;/reconnect-attempts>
   &lt;/connection-factory>

               </programlisting>
               <para>We have added the following attributes to the connection factory used by the client:</para>
               <itemizedlist>
                  <listitem>
                     <para>
                        <literal>ha</literal>
                        - This tells the client it support HA and must always be true for failover
                        to occur
                     </para>
                  </listitem>
                  <listitem>
                     <para>
                        <literal>retry-interval</literal>
                        - this is how long the client will wait after each unsuccessful
                        reconnect to the server
                     </para>
                  </listitem>
                  <listitem>
                     <para>
                        <literal>retry-interval-multiplier</literal>
                        - is used to configure an exponential back off for
                        reconnect attempts
                     </para>
                  </listitem>
                  <listitem>
                     <para>
                        <literal>reconnect-attempts</literal>
                        - how many reconnect attempts should a client make before failing,
                        -1 means unlimited.
                     </para>
                  </listitem>
               </itemizedlist>
            </section>
            <section>
               <title>Backup Server Configuration</title>
               <para>
                  Now let's look at how to create and configure a backup server on the same eap instance. This is running
                  on the same eap instance as the live server from the previous chapter but is configured as the backup
                  for a live server running on a different eap instance.
               </para>
               <para>
                  The first thing to mention is that the backup only needs a <literal>activemq-jboss-beans.xml</literal>
                  and a <literal>activemq-configuration.xml</literal> configuration file. This is because any JMS components
                  are created from the Journal when the backup server becomes live.
               </para>
               <para>
                  Firstly we need to define a new ActiveMQ Server that EAP will deploy. We do this by creating a new
                  <literal>activemq-jboss-beans.xml</literal>
                  configuration. We will place this under a new directory
                  <literal>activemq-backup1</literal>
                  which will need creating
                  in the
                  <literal>deploy</literal>
                  directory but in reality it doesn't matter where this is put. This will look like:
               </para>
               <programlisting>
   &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

   &lt;deployment xmlns="urn:jboss:bean-deployer:2.0">

      &lt;!-- The core configuration -->
      &lt;bean name="BackupConfiguration" class="org.apache.activemq.core.config.impl.FileConfiguration">
         &lt;property
            name="configurationUrl">${jboss.server.home.url}/deploy/activemq-backup1/activemq-configuration.xml&lt;/property>
      &lt;/bean>


      &lt;!-- The core server -->
      &lt;bean name="BackupActiveMQServer" class="org.apache.activemq.core.server.impl.ActiveMQServerImpl">
         &lt;constructor>
            &lt;parameter>
               &lt;inject bean="BackupConfiguration"/>
            &lt;/parameter>
            &lt;parameter>
               &lt;inject bean="MBeanServer"/>
            &lt;/parameter>
            &lt;parameter>
               &lt;inject bean="ActiveMQSecurityManager"/>
            &lt;/parameter>
         &lt;/constructor>
         &lt;start ignored="true"/>
         &lt;stop ignored="true"/>
      &lt;/bean>

      &lt;!-- The JMS server -->
      &lt;bean name="BackupJMSServerManager" class="org.apache.activemq.jms.server.impl.JMSServerManagerImpl">
         &lt;constructor>
            &lt;parameter>
               &lt;inject bean="BackupActiveMQServer"/>
            &lt;/parameter>
         &lt;/constructor>
      &lt;/bean>

   &lt;/deployment>
               </programlisting>
               <para>
                  The first thing to notice is the BackupConfiguration bean. This is configured to pick up the
                  configuration
                  for
                  the
                  server which we will place in the same directory.
               </para>
               <para>
                  After that we just configure a new ActiveMQ Server and JMS server.
               </para>
               <note>
                  <para>
                     Notice that the names of the beans have been changed from that of the live servers configuration.
                     This
                     is
                     so
                     there is no clash. Obviously if you add more backup servers you will need to rename those as well,
                     backup1,
                     backup2 etc.
                  </para>
               </note>
               <para>
                  Now let's add the server configuration in
                  <literal>activemq-configuration.xml</literal>
                  and add it to the same directory
                  <literal>deploy/activemq-backup1</literal>

               </programlisting>
               <para>
                  The second thing you can see is we have added a
                  <literal>jmx-domain</literal>
                  attribute, this is used when
                  adding objects, such as the ActiveMQ server and JMS server to jmx, we change this from the default
                  <literal>org.apache.activemq</literal>
                  to avoid naming clashes with the live server
               </para>
               <para>
                  The first important part of the configuration is to make sure that this server starts as a backup
                  server not
                  a live server, via the
                  <literal>backup</literal>
                  attribute.
               </para>
               <para>
                  After that we have the same cluster configuration as live, that is
                  <literal>clustered</literal>
                  is true and
                  <literal>shared-store</literal>
                  is true. However you can see we have added a new configuration element
                  <literal>allow-failback</literal>. When this is set to true then this backup server will automatically
                  stop
                  and fall back into backup node if failover occurs and the live server has become available. If false
                  then
                  the user will have to stop the server manually.
               </para>
               <para>
                  Next we can see the configuration for the journal location, as in the live configuration this must
                  point to
                  the same directory as this backup's live server.
               </para>
               <para>
                  Now we see the connectors configuration, we have 3 defined which are needed for the following
               </para>
               <itemizedlist>
                  <listitem>
                     <para>
                        <literal>netty-connector.</literal>
                        This is the connector used to connect to this backup server once live.
                     </para>
                  </listitem>
               </itemizedlist>
               <para>After that you will see the acceptors defined, This is the acceptor where clients will reconnect.
               </para>
               <para>
                  The Broadcast groups, Discovery group and cluster configurations are as per normal, details of these
                  can be found in the ActiveMQ user manual.
               </para>
               <note>
                  <para>notice the commented out <literal>max-hops</literal> in the cluster connection, set this to 0 if
                  you want to disable server side load balancing.</para>
               </note>
               <para>
                  When the backup becomes it will be not be servicing any JEE components on this eap instance. Instead any
                  existing messages will be redistributed around the cluster and new messages forwarded to and from the backup
                  to service any remote clients it has (if it has any).

               <title>Configuring multiple backups</title>
               <para>
                  In this instance we have assumed that there are only 2 nodes where each node has a backup for the other
                  node. However you may want to configure a server too have multiple backup nodes. For example you may want
                  3 nodes where each node has 2 backups, one for each of the other 2 live servers. For this you would simply
                  copy the backup configuration and make sure you do the following:
               </para>
               <itemizedlist>
                  <listitem>
                     <para>
                        Make sure that you give all the beans in the <literal>activemq-jboss-beans.xml</literal> configuration
                        file a unique name, i.e.
                     </para>

               <title>Running the shipped example</title>
               <para>
                  EAP ships with an example configuration for this topology. Look under <literal>extras/activemq/resources/examples/symmetric-cluster-with-backups-colocated</literal>
                  and follow the read me

      <section>
         <title>Dedicated Live and Backup in Symmetrical cluster</title>
         <para>
            In reality the configuration for this is exactly the same as the backup server in the previous section, the only
            difference is that a backup will reside on an eap instance of its own rather than colocated with another live server.
            Of course this means that the eap instance is passive and not used until the backup comes live and is only
            really useful for pure JMS applications.
         </para>
         <para>The following diagram shows a possible configuration for this:</para>
         <para>
            <graphic fileref="images/simple-dedicated.jpg" align="center" format="jpg" scale="30"/>
        </para>
         <para>
            Here you can see how this works with remote JMS clients. Once failover occurs the ActiveMQ backup Server takes
            running within another eap instance takes over as live.
         </para>
         <para>
            This is fine with applications that are pure JMS and have no JMS components such as MDB's. If you are using
            JMS components then there are 2 ways that this can be done. The first is shown in the following diagram:
         </para>
         <para>
            <graphic fileref="images/simple-dedicated-jca.jpg" align="center" format="jpg" scale="30"/>
         </para>
         <para>
            Because there is no live activemq server running by default in the eap instance running the backup server it
            makes no sense to host any applications in it. However you can host applications on the server running the live
            activemq server. If failure occurs to an live activemq server then remote jms clients will failover as previously
            explained however what happens to any messages meant for or sent from JEE components. Well when the backup comes
            live, messages will be distributed to and from the backup server over ActiveMQ cluster connections and handled
            appropriately.
         </para>
         <para>
            The second way to do this is to have both live and backup server remote form the eap instance as shown in the
            following diagram.
         </para>
         <para>
            <graphic fileref="images/simple-dedicated-jca-remote.jpg" align="center" format="jpg" scale="30"/>
         </para>
         <para>
            Here you can see that all the Application (via JCA) will be serviced by a ActiveMQ server in its own eap instance.
         </para>
         <section>
            <title>Configuration of dedicated Live and backup</title>
            <para>
               The live server configuration is exactly the same as in the previous example. The only difference of course
               is that there is no backup in the eap instance.
            </para>
            <para>
               For the backup server the <literal>activemq-configuration.xml</literal> is unchanged, however since there is
               no live server we need to make sure that the <literal>activemq-jboss-beans.xml</literal> instantiates all
               the beans needed. For this simply use the same configuration as in the live server changing only the
               location of the <literal>activemq-configuration.xml</literal> parameter for the <literal>Configuration</literal>
               bean.
            </para>
            <para>
               As before there will be no <literal>activemq-jms.xml</literal> or <literal>jms-ds.xml</literal> configuration.
            </para>
            <para>
               If you want both activemq servers to be in there own dedicated server where they are remote to applications,
               as in the last diagram. Then simply edit the <literal>jms-ds.xml</literal> and change the following lines to
            </para>
            <programlisting>
   &lt;config-property name="ConnectorClassName" type="java.lang.String">org.apache.activemq.core.remoting.impl.netty.NettyConnectorFactory&lt;/config-property>
   &lt;config-property name="ConnectionParameters" type="java.lang.String">host=127.0.0.1;port=5446&lt;/config-property>
            </programlisting>
            <para>
               This will change the outbound JCA connector, to configure the inbound connector for MDB's edit the
               <literal>ra.xml</literal> config file and change the following parameters.
            </para>
            <programlisting>
   &lt;config-property>
      &lt;description>The transport type&lt;/description>
      &lt;config-property-name>ConnectorClassName&lt;/config-property-name>
      &lt;config-property-type>java.lang.String&lt;/config-property-type>
      &lt;config-property-value>org.apache.activemq.core.remoting.impl.netty.NettyConnectorFactory&lt;/config-property-value>
   &lt;/config-property>
   &lt;config-property>
      &lt;description>The transport configuration. These values must be in the form of key=val;key=val;&lt;/description>
      &lt;config-property-name>ConnectionParameters&lt;/config-property-name>
      &lt;config-property-type>java.lang.String&lt;/config-property-type>
      &lt;config-property-value>host=127.0.0.1;port=5446&lt;/config-property-value>
   &lt;/config-property>
            </programlisting>
            <para>
               In both cases the host and port should match your live server. If you are using Discovery then set the
               appropriate parameters for <literal>DiscoveryAddress</literal> and <literal>DiscoveryPort</literal> to match
               your configured broadcast groups.
