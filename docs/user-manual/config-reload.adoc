= Configuration Reload
:idprefix:
:idseparator: -
:docinfo: shared

The system will perform a periodic check on the configuration files, configured by `configuration-file-refresh-period`, with the default at `5000`, in milliseconds.
These checks can be disabled by specifying `-1`.

Note that the Log4J2 configuration has its own reload mechanism, configured via its own log4j2.properties file.
See xref:logging.adoc#configuration-reload[Logging configuration reload] for more detail.

Once the configuration file is changed (broker.xml) the following modules will be reloaded automatically:

* Address Settings
* Security Settings
* Diverts
* Addresses & Queues
* Bridges
* Acceptors

If using xref:configuration-index.adoc#modularising-broker-xml[modularised `broker.xml`] ensure you also read xref:configuration-index.adoc#reloading-modular-configuration-files[reloading modular configuration files]

[NOTE]
====
Addresses, queues and diverts can be removed automatically when removed from the configuration:

config-delete-addresses::
* `OFF` (default) - will not remove the address upon config reload.
Messages left in the attached queues will be left intact.
* `FORCE` - will remove the address and its queues upon config reload.
Messages left in the attached queues will be *lost*.

config-delete-queues::
* `OFF` (default) - will not remove the queues upon config reload.
Messages left in the queues will be left intact.
* `FORCE` - will remove the queues.
Messages left in the queues will be *lost*.

config-delete-diverts::
* `OFF` (default) - will not remove the diverts upon config reload.
* `FORCE` - will remove the diverts upon config reload.

By default, all settings are `OFF`, so that addresses, queues and diverts aren't removed upon configuration reload, reducing the risk of losing messages.

Addresses, queues and diverts no longer present in the configuration file can be removed manually via the web interface, CLI, or JMX management operations.
====

== Reloadable Parameters

The broker configuration file has 2 main parts, `<core>` and `<jms>`.
Some of the parameters in the 2 parts are monitored and, if modified, reloaded into the broker at runtime.

NOTE: Elements under `<jms>` are *deprecated*.
Users are encouraged to use `<core>` configuration entities.

[NOTE]
====
Most parameters reloaded take effect immediately after reloading.
However there are some that won't take any effect unless you restarting the broker.
Such parameters are specifically indicated in the following text.
====

=== `<core>`

==== `<security-settings>`

* `<security-setting>` element

Changes to any `<security-setting>` elements will be reloaded.
Each `<security-setting>` defines security roles for a matched address.

* The `match` attribute
+
This attribute defines the address for which the security-setting is defined.
It can take wildcards such as '`#`' and '`*`'.

* The `<permission>` sub-elements

Each `<security-setting>` can have a list of `<permission>` elements, each of which defines a specific permission-roles mapping.
Each permission has 2 attributes '`type`' and '`roles`'.
The '`type`' attribute defines the type of operation allowed, the '`roles`' defines which roles are allowed to perform such operation.
Refer to the user's manual for a list of operations that can be defined.

[NOTE]
====
Once loaded the security-settings will take effect immediately.
Any new clients will subject to the new security settings.
Any existing clients will subject to the new settings as well, as soon as they performs a new security-sensitive operation.
====

Below lists the effects of adding, deleting and updating of an element/attribute within the `<security-settings>` element, whether a change can be done or can't be done.

|===
| Operation | Add | Delete | Update

| `<security-settings>`
| X* (at most one element is allowed)
| Deleting it means delete the whole security settings from the running broker.
| N/A*

| `<security-setting>`
| Adding one element means adding a new set of security roles for an address in the running broker
| Deleting one element means removing a set of security roles for an address in the running broker
| Updating one element means updating the security roles for an address (if match attribute is not changed), or means removing the old match address settings and adding a new one (if match attribute is changed)

| attribute `match`
| N/A*
| X*
| Changing this value is same as deleting the whole `<security-setting> with the old match value and adding `</security-setting>`

| `<permission>`
| Adding one means adding  a new permission definition to runtime broker
| Deleting a permission from the runtime broker
| Updating a permission-roles in the runtime broker

| attribute `type`
| N/A*
| X*
| Changing the type value means remove the permission of the old one and add the permission of this type to the running broker.

| attribute `roles`
| N/A*
| X*
| Changing the '`roles`' value means updating the permission's allowed roles to the running broker
|===

====
* `N/A` means this operation is not applicable.
* `X` means this operation is not allowed.
====

==== `<address-settings>`

* `<address-settings>` element

Changes to elements under `<address-settings>` will be reloaded into runtime broker.
It contains a list of `<address-setting>` elements.

* `<address-setting>` element

Each address-setting element has a '`match`' attribute that defines an address    pattern for which this address-setting is defined.
It also has a list of    sub-elements used to define the properties of a matching address.

[NOTE]
====
Parameters reloaded in this category will take effect immediately after reloading.
The effect of deletion of Address's and Queue's, not auto created is controlled by parameter `config-delete-addresses` and `config-delete-queues` as described in the doc.
