= Embedded Web Server
:idprefix:
:idseparator: -

Apache ActiveMQ Artemis embeds the https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/[Jetty web server].
Its main purpose is to host the xref:management-console.adoc#management-console[Management Console].
However, it can also host other web applications.

== Configuration

The embedded Jetty instance is configured in `etc/bootstrap.xml` via the `web` element, e.g.:

[,xml]
----
<web path="web">
   <binding uri="http://localhost:8161">
      <app url="activemq-branding" war="activemq-branding.war"/>
      <app url="artemis-plugin" war="artemis-plugin.war"/>
      <app url="console" war="console.war"/>
   </binding>
</web>
----

=== Web

The `web` element has the following attributes:

path::
The name of the subdirectory in which to find the web application archives (i.e. WAR files).
This is a subdirectory of the broker's home or instance directory.
customizer::
The name of customizer class to load.
rootRedirectLocation::
The location to redirect the requests with the root target.
webContentEnabled::
Whether or not the content included in the web folder of the home and the instance directories is accessible.
Default is `false`.
maxThreads::
The maximum number of threads the embedded web server can create to service HTTP requests.
Default is `200`.
minThreads::
The minimum number of threads the embedded web server will hold to service HTTP requests.
Default is `8` or the value of `maxThreads` if it is lower.
idleThreadTimeout::
The time to wait before terminating an idle thread from the embedded web server. Measured in milliseconds. Default is `60000`.
scanPeriod::
How often to scan for changes of the key and trust store files related to a binding when the `sslAutoReload` attribute value of the `binding` element is `true`, for further details see <<Binding>>. Measured in seconds. Default is `5`.
maxRequestHeaderSize::
The maximum allowed size for the HTTP request line and HTTP request headers.
Measured in bytes.
Default is `8192`.
maxResponseHeaderSize::
The maximum allowed size for the HTTP response headers.
Measured in bytes.
Default is `8192`.

=== Binding

The `web` element should contain at least one `binding` element to configure how  clients can connect to the web-server.
A `binding` element has the following attributes:

uri::
The protocol to use (i.e. `http` or `https`) as well as the host and port on which to listen.
This attribute is required.

clientAuth::
Whether or not clients should present an SSL certificate when they connect.
Only applicable when using `https`.

passwordCodec::
The custom coded to use for unmasking the `keystorePassword` and `trustStorePassword`.

keyStorePath::
The location on disk of the keystore.
Only applicable when using `https`.

keyStorePassword::
The password to the keystore.
Only applicable when using `https`.
Can be masked using `ENC()` syntax or by defining `passwordCodec`.
See more in the xref:masking-passwords.adoc#masking-passwords[password masking] chapter.

trustStorePath::
The location on disk for the truststore.
Only applicable when using `https`.

trustStorePassword::
The password to the truststore.
Only applicable when using `https`.
Can be masked using `ENC()` syntax or by defining `passwordCodec`.
See more in the xref:masking-passwords.adoc#masking-passwords[password masking] chapter.

includedTLSProtocols::
A comma seperated list of included TLS protocols, ie `"TLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2"`.
Only applicable when using `https`.

excludedTLSProtocols::
A comma seperated list of excluded TLS protocols, ie `"TLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2"`.
Only applicable when using `https`.

includedCipherSuites::
A comma seperated list of included cipher suites.
Only applicable when using `https`.

excludedCipherSuites::
A comma seperated list of excluded cipher suites.
Only applicable when using `https`.

sniHostCheck::
Whether or not the SNI Host name in the client request must match the common name or the subject alternative names in the server certificate.
Default is `true`.
Only applicable when using `https`.

sniRequired::
Whether or not the client request must include an SNI Host name.
Default is `false`.
Only applicable when using `https`.

sslAutoReload::
Whether or not the key and trust store files must be watched for changes and automatically reloaded.
The watch period is controlled by the `scanPeriod` attribute of the `web` element, for further details see <<Web>>.
Default is `false`.

=== App

Each web application should be defined in an `app` element inside an `binding` element.
The `app` element has the following attributes:

url::
The context to use for the web application.
war::
The name of the web application archive on disk.

== Request Log

It's also possible to configure HTTP/S request logging via the `request-log` element which has the following attributes:

filename::
The full path of the request log.
This attribute is required.

append::
Whether or not to append to the existing log or truncate it.
Boolean flag.

extended::
Whether or not to use the extended request log format.
Boolean flag.
If `true` will use the format `+%{client}a - %u %t "%r" %s %O  "%{Referer}i" "%{User-Agent}i"+`.
If `false` will use the format `+%{client}a - %u %t "%r" %s %O+`.
Default is `false`.
See the https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/javadoc/jetty-9/org/eclipse/jetty/server/CustomRequestLog.html[format  specification] for more details.

filenameDateFormat::
The log file name date format.

retainDays::
The number of days before rotated log files are deleted.

ignorePaths::
Request paths that will not be logged.
Comma delimited list.

format::
Custom format to use.
If set this will override `extended`.
See the https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/javadoc/jetty-9/org/eclipse/jetty/server/CustomRequestLog.html[format specification] for more details.

The following options were previously supported, but they were replaced by the `format`: `logCookie`, `logTimeZone`, `logDateFormat`, `logLocale`, `logLatency`, `logServer`, `preferProxiedForAddress`.
All these options are now deprecated and ignored.

These attributes are essentially passed straight through to the underlying https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/javadoc/jetty-9/org/eclipse/jetty/server/CustomRequestLog.html[`org.eclipse.jetty.server.CustomRequestLog`] and https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/javadoc/jetty-9/org/eclipse/jetty/server/RequestLogWriter.html[`org.eclipse.jetty.server.RequestLogWriter`] instances.
Default values are based on these implementations.

Here is an example configuration:

[,xml]
----
<web path="web">
   <binding uri="http://localhost:8161">
      <app url="activemq-branding" war="activemq-branding.war"/>
      <app url="artemis-plugin" war="artemis-plugin.war"/>
      <app url="console" war="console.war"/>
   </binding>
   <request-log filename="${artemis.instance}/log/http-access-yyyy_MM_dd.log" append="true" extended="true"/>
</web>
----

=== System properties

It is possible to use system properties to add or update web configuration items.
If you define a system property starting with "webconfig." it will be parsed at the startup to update the web configuration.

To enable the client authentication for an existing binding with the name `artemis`, set the system property `webconfig.bindings.artemis.clientAuth` to `true`, i.e.
----
java -Dwebconfig.bindings.artemis.clientAuth=true
----

To add a new binding or app set the new binding or app attributes using their new names, i.e.
----
java -Dwebconfig.bindings.my-binding.uri=http://localhost:8162
java -Dwebconfig.bindings.my-binding.apps.my-app.uri=my-app
java -Dwebconfig.bindings.my-binding.apps.my-app.war=my-app.war
----

To update a binding without a name use its uri and to update an app without a name use its url , i.e.
[,xml]
----
<web path="web">
  <binding uri="http://localhost:8161">
    <app url="activemq-branding" war="activemq-branding.war"/>
...
----

----
java -Dwebconfig.bindings."http://localhost:8161".clientAuth=true
----

----
java -Dwebconfig.bindings."http://localhost:8161".apps."activemq-branding".war=my-branding.war
----

== Proxy Forwarding

The proxies and load balancers usually support `X-Forwarded` headers to send information altered or lost when a proxy is involved in the path of the request.
Jetty supports the https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/javadoc/current/org/eclipse/jetty/server/ForwardedRequestCustomizer.html[`ForwardedRequestCustomizer`] customizer to handle `X-Forwarded` headers.
Set the `customizer` attribute via the `web` element to enable the https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/javadoc/current/org/eclipse/jetty/server/ForwardedRequestCustomizer.html[`ForwardedRequestCustomizer`] customizer, ie:

[,xml]
----
<web path="web" customizer="org.eclipse.jetty.server.ForwardedRequestCustomizer">
   <binding uri="http://localhost:8161">
      <app url="activemq-branding" war="activemq-branding.war"/>
      <app url="artemis-plugin" war="artemis-plugin.war"/>
      <app url="console" war="console.war"/>
   </binding>
</web>
----

== Management

The embedded web server can be stopped, started, or restarted via any available management interface via the `stopEmbeddedWebServer`, `starteEmbeddedWebServer`, and `restartEmbeddedWebServer` operations on the `ActiveMQServerControl`  respectively.
