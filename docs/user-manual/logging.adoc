= Logging
:idprefix:
:idseparator: -

Apache ActiveMQ Artemis uses the https://www.slf4j.org/[SLF4J] logging facade for logging, with the broker assembly providing https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/[Log4J 2] as the logging implementation.
When the broker is started by executing the `run` command, this is configurable via the `log4j2.properties` file found in the broker instance `etc` directory, which is configured by default to log to both the console and to a file. For the other CLI commands, this is configurable via the `log4j2-utility.properties` file found in the broker instance `etc` directory, which is configured by default to log only errors to the console (in addition to the usual command output).

There are a handful of general loggers available:

|===
| Logger | Description

| rootLogger
| Logs any calls not handled by the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis loggers

| org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.server
| Logs the core server

| org.apache.activemq.artemis.utils
| Logs utility calls

| org.apache.activemq.artemis.journal
| Logs Journal calls

| org.apache.activemq.artemis.jms
| Logs JMS calls

| org.apache.activemq.artemis.integration.bootstrap
| Logs bootstrap calls

| org.apache.activemq.audit.base
| audit log.
Disabled by default

| org.apache.activemq.audit.resource
| resource audit log.
Disabled by default

| org.apache.activemq.audit.message
| message audit log.
Disabled by default

== Configuring a Specific Level for a Logger

Sometimes it is necessary to get more detailed logs from a particular logger.
For example, when you're trying to troublshoot an issue.
Say you needed to get TRACE logging from the logger `org.foo`.

Then you need to configure the logging level for the `org.foo` logger to `TRACE`, e.g.:

----
logger.my_logger_ref.name=org.foo
logger.my_logger_ref.level=TRACE
----

== Configuration Reload

Log4J2 has its own configuration file reloading mechanism, which is itself configured via the same log4j2.properties configuration file.
To enable reload upon configuration updates, set the `monitorInterval` config property to the interval in seconds that the file should be monitored for updates, e.g.
----
# Monitor config file every 5 seconds for updates
monitorInterval = 5
----

== Logging in a client application

Firstly, if you want to enable logging on the client side you need to include a logging implementation in your application which supports the SLF4J facade.
Taking Log4J2 as an example logging implementation, since it used by the broker, when using Maven your client and logging dependencies might be e.g.:

[,xml,subs="normal"]
----
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.apache.activemq</groupId>
   <artifactId>artemis-jms-client</artifactId>
   <version>{project-version}</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.apache.logging.log4j</groupId>
   <artifactId>log4j-slf4j2-impl</artifactId>
   <version>{log4j-version}</version>
</dependency>
----

The Log4J2 configuration can then be supplied via file called `log4j2.properties` on the classpath which will then be picked up automatically.

Alternatively, use of a specific configuration file can be configured via system property `log4j2.configurationFile`, e.g.:

----
-Dlog4j2.configurationFile=file:///path/to/custom-log4j2-config.properties
----

The following is an example `log4j2.properties` for a client application, logging at INFO level to the console and a daily rolling file.

----
# Log4J 2 configuration

# Monitor config file every X seconds for updates
monitorInterval = 5

rootLogger.level = INFO
rootLogger.appenderRef.console.ref = console
rootLogger.appenderRef.log_file.ref = log_file

logger.activemq.name=org.apache.activemq
logger.activemq.level=INFO

# Console appender
appender.console.type=Console
appender.console.name=console
appender.console.layout.type=PatternLayout
appender.console.layout.pattern=%d %-5level [%logger] %msg%n

# Log file appender
appender.log_file.type = RollingFile
appender.log_file.name = log_file
appender.log_file.fileName = log/application.log
appender.log_file.filePattern = log/application.log.%d{yyyy-MM-dd}
appender.log_file.layout.type = PatternLayout
appender.log_file.layout.pattern = %d %-5level [%logger] %msg%n
appender.log_file.policies.type = Policies
appender.log_file.policies.cron.type = CronTriggeringPolicy
appender.log_file.policies.cron.schedule = 0 0 0 * * ?
appender.log_file.policies.cron.evaluateOnStartup = true
----

== Configuring Broker Audit Logging

There are 3 audit loggers that can be enabled separately and audit  different types of broker events, these are:

. *base*: This is a highly verbose logger that will capture most  events that occur on JMX beans.
. *resource*: This logs the creation of, updates to, and deletion of resources such as addresses and queues as well as authentication.
The main purpose of this is to track console activity and access to the broker.
. *message*: This logs the production and consumption of messages.

[NOTE]
====


All extra logging will negatively impact performance.
Whether or not the performance impact is "too much" will depend on your use-case.
====

These three audit loggers are disabled by default in the broker `log4j2.properties` configuration file:

----
...
# Audit loggers: to enable change levels from OFF to INFO
logger.audit_base.name = org.apache.activemq.audit.base
logger.audit_base.level = OFF
logger.audit_base.appenderRef.audit_log_file.ref = audit_log_file
logger.audit_base.additivity = false

logger.audit_resource.name = org.apache.activemq.audit.resource
logger.audit_resource.level = OFF
logger.audit_resource.appenderRef.audit_log_file.ref = audit_log_file
logger.audit_resource.additivity = false

logger.audit_message.name = org.apache.activemq.audit.message
logger.audit_message.level = OFF
logger.audit_message.appenderRef.audit_log_file.ref = audit_log_file
logger.audit_message.additivity = false
...
----

To _enable_ the audit log change the level to `INFO`, like this:

----
logger.audit_base.level = INFO
...
logger.audit_resource.level = INFO
...
logger.audit_message.level = INFO
----

The 3 audit loggers can be disable/enabled separately.

Once enabled, all audit records are written into a separate log file (by default `audit.log`).
