One of the simplest ways to get started with ActiveMQ Artemis is by using one of our Docker images.

== Official Images

Official https://www.docker.com/[Docker] images are https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/activemq-artemis/tags[available on dockerhub].
Images are pushed along with all the other distribution artifacts for every release.
The fastest, simplest way to get started is with this command which will create and start a detached container named `mycontainer`, expose the main messaging port (i.e. `61616`) and HTTP port (i.e. `8161`), and remove it when it terminates:

[,console]
----
$ docker run --detach --name mycontainer -p 61616:61616 -p 8161:8161 --rm apache/activemq-artemis:latest-alpine
----

Once the broker starts you can open the xref:management-console.adoc[web management console] at http://localhost:8161 and log in with the default username & password `artemis`.

You can also use the `shell` command to interact with the running broker using the default username & password `artemis`, e.g.:

[,console]
----
$ docker exec -it mycontainer /var/lib/artemis-instance/bin/artemis shell --user artemis --password artemis
----

Using the `shell` command you can execute basic tasks like creating & deleting addresses and queues, sending and browsing messages, viewing queue statistics, etc.
See the xref:using-cli.adoc#command-line-interface[Command Line Interface] chapter for more details.

You can view the container's logs using:
[,console]
----
$ docker logs -f mycontainer
----

Stop the container using:
[,console]
----
$ docker stop mycontainer
----

The official Docker images are built using https://github.com/apache/activemq-artemis/tree/main/artemis-docker[these scripts] which you can also use to build your own images.
Read on for more details.

== Build your own Image

In order to build an image you need an ActiveMQ Artemis binary distribution.
This can be sourced *locally* (in which case you need to build the project first) or *remotely* based on an official Apache release.

=== Using a Local Release
If you want to use a local binary distribution then build it from the root of the ActiveMQ source tree, e.g.:
[,console]
----
$ mvn -Prelease package -DskipTests
----
Following the build the distribution files will be in your local distribution directory.
Here `<version>` is the version of the distribution that you built.

----
artemis-distribution/target/apache-artemis-<version>-bin/apache-artemis-<version>
----

Then switch to the `artemis-docker` directory and use the `prepare-docker.sh` script with the proper parameters to copy the Docker files into your local binary distribution, e.g.:

[,console]
----
$ cd artemis-docker
$ ./prepare-docker.sh --from-local-dist --local-dist-path ../artemis-distribution/target/apache-artemis-<version>-bin/apache-artemis-<version>/
----

This will copy all the files necessary to build any of the pre-configured Docker images and provide you with additional instructions.
Follow these instructions to finish building the image you want based on one of the provided Docker files or even one of your own.

=== Using an Official Apache Release
If you would rather use an official Apache release in your image rather than a local release then run the following command from the `artemis-docker` directory where `<version>` is the release version you wish to use (e.g. `2.30.0`):

[,console]
----
$ ./prepare-docker.sh --from-release --artemis-version <version>
----

This will copy all the files necessary to build any of the pre-configured Docker images and provide you with additional instructions.
Follow these instructions to finish building the image you want based on one of the provided Docker files or even one of your own.

=== Customizing the Image

==== Environment Variables

Environment variables determine the options configured for the `artemis create` command when running `docker build`.
The available options are:

`ARTEMIS_USER`::
The administrator username. The default is `artemis`.

`ARTEMIS_PASSWORD`::
The administrator password. The default is `artemis`.

`ANONYMOUS_LOGIN`::
Set to `true` to allow anonymous logins. The default is `false`.

`EXTRA_ARGS`::
Additional arguments sent to the `artemis create` command. The default is `--http-host 0.0.0.0 --relax-jolokia`.
Setting this value will override the default. See the documentation on `artemis create` for available options.

The combination of the above environment variables results in the `docker-run.sh` script calling the following command to create the broker instance the first time the Docker container runs:

[,console]
----
${ARTEMIS_HOME}/bin/artemis create --user ${ARTEMIS_USER} --password ${ARTEMIS_PASSWORD} --silent ${LOGIN_OPTION} ${EXTRA_ARGS}
----

Note: `LOGIN_OPTION` is either `--allow-anonymous` or `--require-login` depending on the value of `ANONYMOUS_LOGIN`.

These variables can be set in the relevant Dockerfile or, for example, on the command-line, e.g.:
[,console]
----
$ docker run -e ARTEMIS_USER=myUser -e ARTEMIS_PASSWORD=myPass --name mycontainer -it -p 61616:61616 -p 8161:8161 apache/activemq-artemis:latest-alpine
----

==== Mapping point

The image will use the directory `/var/lib/artemis-instance` to hold the configuration and the data of the running broker.
You can map this to a folder on the host for when you want the configuration and data persisted *outside* of a container, e.g.:
[,console]
----
docker run -it -p 61616:61616 -p 8161:8161 -v <broker folder on host>:/var/lib/artemis-instance apache/activemq-artemis:latest-alpine
----
In this case the value `<broker folder on host>` is a directory where the broker instance is supposed to
be saved and reused on each run.

==== Overriding files in `etc` folder

You can use customized configuration for the ActiveMQ Artemis instance by replacing the files residing in the `etc` folder with the custom ones, e.g. `broker.xml` or `artemis.profile`.
Put the replacement files inside a folder and map it as a volume to:
----
/var/lib/artemis-instance/etc-override
----

The contents of `etc-override` folder will be copied over to `etc` folder after the instance creation so that the broker will always start with user-supplied configuration.

It you are mapping the whole `var/lib/artemis-instance` to an outside folder for persistence then you can place an `etc-override` folder inside the mapped one.
Its contents will again be copied over `etc` folder after creating the instance.
