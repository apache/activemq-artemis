= Protocols and Interoperability
:idprefix:
:idseparator: -

Apache ActiveMQ Artemis has a powerful & flexible core which provides a foundation upon which other protocols can be implemented.
Each protocol implementation translates the ideas of its specific protocol onto this core.

The broker ships with a client implementation which interacts directly with this core.
It uses what's called the xref:core.adoc#using-core["core" API], and it communicates over the network using the "core" protocol.

== Supported Protocols

The broker has a pluggable protocol architecture.
Protocol plugins come in the form of protocol modules.
Each protocol  module is included on the broker's class path and loaded by the broker at boot time.
The broker ships with 5 protocol  modules out of the box.

=== AMQP

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMQP[AMQP] is a specification for interoperable messaging.
It also defines a wire format, so any AMQP client can work with any messaging system that supports AMQP.
AMQP clients are available in many different programming languages.

Apache ActiveMQ Artemis implements the https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=amqp[AMQP 1.0] specification.
Any client that supports the 1.0 specification will be able to interact with Apache ActiveMQ Artemis.

Please see xref:amqp.adoc#amqp[AMQP] for more details.

=== MQTT

https://mqtt.org/[MQTT] is a lightweight connectivity protocol.
It is designed to run in environments where device and networks are constrained.
Any client that supports the 3.1, 3.1.1, or 5 specification will be able to interact with Apache ActiveMQ Artemis.

Please see xref:mqtt.adoc#mqtt[MQTT] for more details.

=== STOMP

https://stomp.github.io/[Stomp] is a very simple text protocol for interoperating with messaging systems.
It defines a wire format, so theoretically any Stomp client can work with any messaging system that supports Stomp.
Stomp clients are available in many different programming languages.
Any client that supports the 1.0, 1.1, or 1.2 specification will be able to interact with Apache ActiveMQ Artemis.

Please see xref:stomp.adoc#stomp[Stomp] for more details.

=== OpenWire

ActiveMQ Classic defines its own wire protocol: OpenWire.
In order to support ActiveMQ "Classic" clients, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis supports OpenWire.
Any ActiveMQ 5.12.x or higher can be used with Apache ActiveMQ Artemis.

Please see xref:openwire.adoc#openwire[OpenWire] for more details.

=== Core

ActiveMQ Classic defines its own wire protocol: OpenWire.
In order to support ActiveMQ "Classic" clients, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis supports OpenWire.
Any ActiveMQ 5.12.x or higher can be used with Apache ActiveMQ Artemis.

Please see xref:core.adoc#using-core[Core] for more details.

==== APIs and Other Interfaces

Although JMS and Jakarta Messaging are standardized APIs, they do not define a network protocol.
The ActiveMQ Artemis xref:using-jms.adoc#using-jms-or-jakarta-messaging[JMS & Jakarta Messaging clients] are implemented on top of the core protocol.
We also provide a xref:using-jms.adoc#jndi[client-side JNDI implementation].

== Configuring Acceptors

In order to make use of a particular protocol, a transport must be configured with the desired protocol enabled.
There is a whole section on configuring transports that can be found xref:configuring-transports.adoc#configuring-the-transport[here].

The default configuration shipped with the ActiveMQ Artemis distribution comes with a number of acceptors already defined, one for each of the above protocols plus a generic acceptor that supports all protocols.
To enable  protocols on a particular acceptor simply add the `protocols` url parameter to the acceptor url where the value is one or more protocols (separated by commas).
If the `protocols` parameter is omitted from the url *all* protocols are  enabled.

* The following example enables only MQTT on port 1883
+
[,xml]
----
<acceptors>
   <acceptor>tcp://localhost:1883?protocols=MQTT</acceptor>
</acceptors>
----

* The following example enables MQTT and AMQP on port 5672
+
[,xml]
----
<acceptors>
   <acceptor>tcp://localhost:5672?protocols=MQTT,AMQP</acceptor>
</acceptors>
----

* The following example enables *all* protocols on `61616`:
+
[,xml]
----
<acceptors>
   <acceptor>tcp://localhost:61616</acceptor>
</acceptors>
----

Here are the supported protocols and their corresponding value used in the `protocols` url parameter.

|===
| Protocol | `protocols` value

| Core (Artemis & HornetQ native) | `CORE`
| OpenWire (5.x native) | `OPENWIRE`
| AMQP | `AMQP`
| MQTT | `MQTT`
| STOMP | `STOMP`
