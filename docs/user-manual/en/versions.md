This chapter provides the following information for each release:
- A link to the full release notes which includes all issues resolved in the release.
- A brief list of "highlights" when applicable.
- If necessary, specific steps required when upgrading from the previous version. 
  - **Note:** If the upgrade spans multiple versions then the steps from **each** version need to be followed in order.
  - **Note:** Follow the general upgrade procedure outlined in the [Upgrading the Broker](upgrading.md) 
    chapter in addition to any version-specific upgrade instructions outlined here.

## 2.9.0

[Full release notes](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12315920&version=12345527).

This was a light release. It included a handful of bug fixes, a few improvements, and one major new feature.

Highlights:
- Support [exporting metrics](metrics.md).

## 2.8.1

[Full release notes](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12315920&version=12345432).

This was mainly a bug-fix release with a notable dependency change impacting version upgrade.

#### Upgrading from 2.8.0

Due to the dependency upgrade made on [ARTEMIS-2319](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARTEMIS-2319) the
broker start scripts need to be adjusted after upgrading.

##### On \*nix

Locate this `if` statement in `bin/artemis`:
```
if [ -z "$LOG_MANAGER" ] ; then
 # this is the one found when the server was created
 LOG_MANAGER="$ARTEMIS_HOME/lib/jboss-logmanager-2.0.3.Final.jar"
fi
```
This needs to be replaced with this block:
```
if [ -z "$LOG_MANAGER" ] ; then
 # this is the one found when the server was created
 LOG_MANAGER="$ARTEMIS_HOME/lib/jboss-logmanager-2.1.10.Final.jar"
fi

WILDFLY_COMMON=`ls $ARTEMIS_HOME/lib/wildfly-common*jar 2>/dev/null`
if [ -z "$WILDFLY_COMMON" ] ; then
 # this is the one found when the server was created
 WILDFLY_COMMON="$ARTEMIS_HOME/lib/wildfly-common-1.5.1.Final.jar"
fi
```
Notice that the `jboss-logmanager` version has changed and there is also a new `wildfly-common` library.

Not much further down there is this line:
```
-Xbootclasspath/a:"$LOG_MANAGER" \
```
This line should be changed to be:
```
-Xbootclasspath/a:"$LOG_MANAGER:$WILDFLY_COMMON" \
```

##### On Windows

Locate this part of `JAVA_ARGS` in `etc/artemis.profile.cmd`:
```
-Xbootclasspath/a:%ARTEMIS_HOME%\lib\jboss-logmanager-2.1.10.Final.jar
```
This needs to be replaced with this:
```
-Xbootclasspath/a:%ARTEMIS_HOME%\lib\jboss-logmanager-2.1.10.Final.jar;%ARTEMIS_HOME%\lib\wildfly-common-1.5.1.Final.jar}
```

#### Upgrading from 2.4.0

1. Due to changes from [ARTEMIS-1644](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARTEMIS-1644) any `acceptor` that needs to be
   compatible with HornetQ and/or Artemis 1.x clients needs to have `anycastPrefix=jms.queue.;multicastPrefix=jms.topic.`
   in the `acceptor` url. This prefix used to be configured automatically behind the scenes when the broker detected 
   these old types of clients, but that broke certain use-cases with no possible work-around. See 
   [ARTEMIS-1644](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARTEMIS-1644) for more details.

## 2.4.0

[Full release notes](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12315920&version=12341540).

Highlights:
- [JMX configuration via XML](management.md#role-based-authorisation-for-jmx) rather than having to use system properties via command line or start script.
- Configuration of [max frame payload length for STOMP web-socket](protocols-interoperability.md#stomp-over-web-sockets).
- Ability to configure HA using JDBC persistence.
- Implement [role-based access control for management objects](management.md).

#### Upgrading from 2.3.0

1. Create `<ARTEMIS_INSTANCE>/etc/management.xml`. At the very least, the file must contain this:
   ```xml
   <management-context xmlns="http://activemq.org/schema"/>
   ```
   This configures role based authorisation for JMX. Read more in the [Management](management.md) documentation.
1. If configured, remove the Jolokia war file from the `web` element in `<ARTEMIS_INSTANCE>/etc/bootstrap.xml`:
   ```xml
   <app url="jolokia" war="jolokia.war"/>
   ``` 
   This is no longer required as the Jolokia REST interface is now integrated into the console web application.
   
   If the following is absent and you desire to deploy the web console then add:
   ```xml
   <app url="console" war="console.war"/>
   ```   
   **Note:** the Jolokia REST interface URL will now be at `http://<host>:<port>/console/jolokia`

Highlights:
- [Web admin console](management-console.md)!
- [Critical Analysis](critical-analysis.md) and deadlock detection on broker
- Support [Netty native kqueue](configuring-transports.md#macos-native-transport) on Mac.
- [Last-value queue](last-value-queues.md) for AMQP

#### Upgrading from 2.2.0

1. If you desire to deploy the web console then add the following to the `web` element in `<ARTEMIS_INSTANCE>/etc/bootstrap.xml`:
   ```xml
   <app url="console" war="console.war"/>
   ```
