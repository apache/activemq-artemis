# Configuration Reference

This section is a quick index for looking up configuration. Click on the
element name to go to the specific chapter.

## Broker Configuration

### broker.xml

This is the main core server configuration file which contains the `core`
element. The `core` element contains the main server configuration.

#### Modularising broker.xml

XML XInclude support is provided in `broker.xml` so that you can break your configuration out into separate files.

To do this ensure the following is defined at the root configuration element.

```
xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
```

You can now define include tag's where you want to bring in xml configuration from another file:

```
<xi:include href="my-address-settings.xml"/>
```

You should ensure xml elements in separated files should be namespaced correctly for example if address-settings element was separated, it should have the element namespace defined:

```
 <address-settings xmlns="urn:activemq:core">
```

An example can of this feature can be seen in the test suites:
```
./artemis-server/src/test/resources/ConfigurationTest-xinclude-config.xml
```
**Note:** if you use `xmllint` to validate the XML against the schema you should enable xinclude flag when running.

```
--xinclude
```

For further information on XInclude see:

[https://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude/](https://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude/)

To disable XML external entity processing use the system property `artemis.disableXxe`, e.g.:
```
-Dartemis.disableXxe=true
```

##### Reloading modular configuration files

Certain changes in `broker.xml` can be picked up at runtime as discussed in the [Configuration Reload](config-reload.md)
chapter. Changes made directly to files which are included in `broker.xml` via `xi:include` will not be automatically
reloaded. For example, if `broker.xml` is including `my-address-settings.xml` and `my-address-settings.xml` is modified
those changes won't be reloaded automatically. To force a reload in this situation there are 2 main options:

1. Use the `reloadConfiguration` management operation on the `ActiveMQServerControl`.
2. Update the timestamp on `broker.xml` using something like the [touch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_%28Unix%29)
   command. The next time the broker inspects `broker.xml` for automatic reload it will see the updated timestamp and
   trigger a reload of `broker.xml` and all its included files.

### System properties

It is possible to use System properties to replace some of the configuration properties. If you define a System property starting with "brokerconfig." that will be passed along to Bean Utils and the configuration would be replaced.

To define global-max-size=1000000 using a system property you would have to define this property, for example through java arguments:

```
java -Dbrokerconfig.globalMaxSize=1000000
```

You can also change the prefix through the `broker.xml` by setting:

```
<system-property-prefix>yourprefix</system-property-prefix>
```

This is to help you customize artemis on embedded systems.

### Broker properties

Broker properties extends the use of properties to allow updates and additions to the broker configuration after
any xml has been parsed. In the absence of any broker.xml, the hard coded defaults can be modified.
Internally, any xml configuration is applied to a java bean style configuration object. Typically, there are
setters for each of the xml attributes. However, for properties, the naming convention changes from 'a-b' to 'aB' to
reflect the camelCase java naming convention.

Collections need some special treatment to allow additions and reference. We utilise the name attribute of configuration
entities to find existing entries and when populating new entities, we set the name to match the requested key.
Removal of configuration from named collections is supported by setting a key value to "-". The remove match value can be configured with a property key "remove.value".

For example, a properties file containing:

```
securityEnabled=false
acceptorConfigurations.tcp.factoryClassName=org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.remoting.impl.netty.NettyAcceptorFactory
acceptorConfigurations.tcp.params.HOST=localhost
acceptorConfigurations.tcp.params.PORT=61616
```
would:
1) disable RBAC security checks
2) add or modify an acceptor named "tcp" that will use Netty
3) set the acceptor named "tcp" 'HOST' parameter to localhost
4) set the acceptor named "tcp" 'PORT' parameter to 61616

The configuration properties are low level, lower level than xml, however it is very powerful; any accessible attribute of the
internal `org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.config.impl.ConfigurationImpl` objects can be modified.

With great power one must take great care!

The `artemis run` command script supports `--properties <properties file url>`, where a properties file can be configured.

_Note_: one shortcoming of this method of configuration is that any property that does not match is ignored with no fanfare.
Enable debug logging for `org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.config.impl.ConfigurationImpl` to get more insight.

There are a growing number of examples of what can be explicitly configured in this way in the [unit test](https://github.com/apache/activemq-artemis/blob/065bfe14f532858f2c2a20b0afb1a226b08ce013/artemis-server/src/test/java/org/apache/activemq/artemis/core/config/impl/ConfigurationImplTest.java#L675).

For a partial list of some of the properties that are available and have been tested see [Broker Properties Reference](#broker-properties-reference)



## The core configuration

This describes the root of the XML configuration. You will see here also multiple sub-types listed.
For example on the main config you will have bridges and at the [list of bridge](#bridge-type) type we will describe the properties for that configuration.

> **Warning**
>
> The default values listed below are the values which will be used if
> the configuration parameter is **not set** either programmatically or
> via `broker.xml`. Some of these values are set in the `broker.xml`
> which is available out-of-the-box. Any values set in the
> out-of-the-box configuration will override the default values listed
> here. Please consult your specific configuration to know which values
> will actually be used when the broker is running.
