Configuration Reference
=======================

This section is a quick index for looking up configuration. Click on the
element name to go to the specific chapter.

Server Configuration
====================

broker.xml
--------------------------

This is the main core server configuration file which contains to elements
'core' and 'jms'.
The 'core' element contains the main server configuration while the 'jms'
element is used by the server side JMS service to load JMS Queues, Topics

# System properties

It is possible to use System properties to replace some of the configuration properties. If you define a System property starting with "brokerconfig." that will be passed along to Bean Utils and the configuration would be replaced.

To define global-max-size=1000000 using a system property you would have to define this property, for example through java arguments:

```
java -Dbrokerconfig.globalMaxSize=1000000
```

You can also change the prefix through the broker.xml by setting:

```
<system-property-prefix>yourprefix</system-property-prefix>
```

This is to help you customize artemis on embedded systems.

# The core configuration

This describes the root of the XML configuration. You will see here also multiple sub-types listed.
For example on the main config you will have bridges and at the [list of bridge](#bridge-type) type we will describe the properties for that configuration.

Using Masked Passwords in Configuration Files
---------------------------------------------

By default all passwords in Apache ActiveMQ Artemis server's configuration files are in
plain text form. This usually poses no security issues as those files
should be well protected from unauthorized accessing. However, in some
circumstances a user doesn't want to expose its passwords to more eyes
than necessary.

Apache ActiveMQ Artemis can be configured to use 'masked' passwords in its
configuration files. A masked password is an obscure string
representation of a real password. To mask a password a user will use an
'encoder'. The encoder takes in the real password and outputs the masked
version. A user can then replace the real password in the configuration
files with the new masked password. When Apache ActiveMQ Artemis loads a masked
password, it uses a suitable 'decoder' to decode it into real password.

Apache ActiveMQ Artemis provides a default password encoder and decoder. Optionally
users can use or implement their own encoder and decoder for masking the
passwords.

### Password Masking in Server Configuration File

#### The password masking property

The server configuration file has a property that defines the default
masking behaviors over the entire file scope.

`mask-password`: this boolean type property indicates if a password
should be masked or not. Set it to "true" if you want your passwords
masked. The default value is "false".

#### Specific masking behaviors

##### cluster-password

The nature of the value of cluster-password is subject to the value of
property 'mask-password'. If it is true the cluster-password is masked.

##### Passwords in connectors and acceptors

In the server configuration, Connectors and Acceptors sometimes needs to
specify passwords. For example if a users wants to use an SSL-enabled
NettyAcceptor, it can specify a key-store-password and a
trust-store-password. Because Acceptors and Connectors are pluggable
implementations, each transport will have different password masking
needs.

When a Connector or Acceptor configuration is initialised, Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will
add the "mask-password" and "password-codec" values to the Connector or
Acceptors params using the keys `activemq.usemaskedpassword` and
`activemq.passwordcodec` respectively. The Netty and InVM
implementations will use these as needed and any other implementations
will have access to these to use if they so wish.

##### Passwords in Core Bridge configurations

Core Bridges are configured in the server configuration file and so the
masking of its 'password' properties follows the same rules as that of
'cluster-password'.

#### Examples

The following table summarizes the relations among the above-mentioned
properties

  mask-password  | cluster-password  | acceptor/connector passwords |  bridge password
  :------------- | :---------------- | :--------------------------- | :---------------
  absent   |       plain text     |    plain text       |              plain text
  false    |       plain text     |    plain text       |              plain text
  true     |       masked         |    masked           |              masked

Examples

Note: In the following examples if related attributed or properties are
absent, it means they are not specified in the configure file.

example 1

```xml
<cluster-password>bbc</cluster-password>
```

This indicates the cluster password is a plain text value ("bbc").

example 2

```xml
<mask-password>true</mask-password>
<cluster-password>80cf731af62c290</cluster-password>
```

This indicates the cluster password is a masked value and Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will
use its built-in decoder to decode it. All other passwords in the
configuration file, Connectors, Acceptors and Bridges, will also use
masked passwords.

### JMS Bridge password masking

The JMS Bridges are configured and deployed as separate beans so they
need separate configuration to control the password masking. A JMS
Bridge has two password parameters in its constructor, SourcePassword
and TargetPassword. It uses the following two optional properties to
control their masking:

`useMaskedPassword` -- If set to "true" the passwords are masked.
Default is false.

`passwordCodec` -- Class name and its parameters for the Decoder used to
decode the masked password. Ignored if `useMaskedPassword` is false. The
format of this property is a full qualified class name optionally
followed by key/value pairs, separated by semi-colons. For example:

```xml
<property name="useMaskedPassword">true</property>
<property name="passwordCodec">com.foo.FooDecoder;key=value</property>
```

Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will load this property and initialize the class with a
parameter map containing the "key"-\>"value" pair. If `passwordCodec` is
not specified, the built-in decoder is used.

### Masking passwords in ActiveMQ Artemis ResourceAdapters and MDB activation configurations

Both ra.xml and MDB activation configuration have a 'password' property
that can be masked. They are controlled by the following two optional
Resource Adapter properties in ra.xml:

`UseMaskedPassword` -- If setting to "true" the passwords are masked.
Default is false.

`PasswordCodec` -- Class name and its parameters for the Decoder used to
decode the masked password. Ignored if UseMaskedPassword is false. The
format of this property is a full qualified class name optionally
followed by key/value pairs. It is the same format as that for JMS
Bridges. Example:

```xml
<config-property>
  <config-property-name>UseMaskedPassword</config-property-name>
  <config-property-type>boolean</config-property-type>
  <config-property-value>true</config-property-value>
</config-property>
<config-property>
  <config-property-name>PasswordCodec</config-property-name>
  <config-property-type>java.lang.String</config-property-type>
  <config-property-value>com.foo.ADecoder;key=helloworld</config-property-value>
</config-property>
```

With this configuration, both passwords in ra.xml and all of its MDBs
will have to be in masked form.

### Masking passwords in artemis-users.properties

Apache ActiveMQ Artemis's built-in security manager uses plain properties files
where the user passwords are specified in hash forms by default. 

Please use Artemis CLI command to add a password. For example

```sh
    ./artemis user add --username guest --password guest --role admin
```

### Choosing a decoder for password masking

As described in the previous sections, all password masking requires a
decoder. A decoder uses an algorithm to convert a masked password into
its original clear text form in order to be used in various security
operations. The algorithm used for decoding must match that for
encoding. Otherwise the decoding may not be successful.

For user's convenience Apache ActiveMQ Artemis provides a default built-in Decoder.
However a user can if they so wish implement their own.

#### The built-in Decoder

Whenever no decoder is specified in the configuration file, the built-in
decoder is used. The class name for the built-in decoder is
org.apache.activemq.artemis.utils.DefaultSensitiveStringCodec. It has both
encoding and decoding capabilities. It uses java.crypto.Cipher utilities
to encrypt (encode) a plaintext password and decrypt a mask string using
same algorithm. Using this decoder/encoder is pretty straightforward. To
get a mask for a password, just run the main class at org.apache.activemq.artemis.utils.DefaultSensitiveStringCodec.

An easy way to do it is through activemq-tools-<VERSION>-jar-with-dependencies.jar since it has all the dependencies:

```sh
    java -cp artemis-tools-1.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar org.apache.activemq.artemis.utils.DefaultSensitiveStringCodec "your plaintext password"
```

If you don't want to use the jar-with-dependencies, make sure the classpath is correct. You'll get something like

```
    Encoded password: 80cf731af62c290
```

Just copy "80cf731af62c290" and replace your plaintext password with it.

#### Using a different decoder

It is possible to use a different decoder rather than the built-in one.
Simply make sure the decoder is in Apache ActiveMQ Artemis's classpath and configure
the server to use it as follows:

```xml
    <password-codec>com.foo.SomeDecoder;key1=value1;key2=value2</password-codec>
```

If your decoder needs params passed to it you can do this via key/value
pairs when configuring. For instance if your decoder needs say a
"key-location" parameter, you can define like so:

```xml
    <password-codec>com.foo.NewDecoder;key-location=/some/url/to/keyfile</password-codec>
```

Then configure your cluster-password like this:

```xml
    <mask-password>true</mask-password>
    <cluster-password>masked_password</cluster-password>
```

When Apache ActiveMQ Artemis reads the cluster-password it will initialize the
NewDecoder and use it to decode "mask\_password". It also process all
passwords using the new defined decoder.

#### Implementing your own codecs

To use a different decoder than the built-in one, you either pick one
from existing libraries or you implement it yourself. All decoders must
implement the `org.apache.activemq.artemis.utils.SensitiveDataCodec<T>`
interface:

``` java
public interface SensitiveDataCodec<T>
{
   T decode(Object mask) throws Exception;

   void init(Map<String, String> params);
}
```

This is a generic type interface but normally for a password you just
need String type. So a new decoder would be defined like

```java
public class MyNewDecoder implements SensitiveDataCodec<String>
{
   public String decode(Object mask) throws Exception
   {
      //decode the mask into clear text password
      return "the password";
   }

   public void init(Map<String, String> params)
   {
      //initialization done here. It is called right after the decoder has been created.
   }
}
```

Last but not least, once you get your own decoder, please add it to the
classpath. Otherwise Apache ActiveMQ Artemis will fail to load it!
