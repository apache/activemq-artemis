# Configuration Reference

This section is a quick index for looking up configuration. Click on the
element name to go to the specific chapter.

## Broker Configuration

### broker.xml

This is the main core server configuration file which contains the `core`
element. The `core` element contains the main server configuration.

#### Modularising broker.xml

XML XInclude support is provided in `broker.xml` so that you can break your configuration out into separate files.

To do this ensure the following is defined at the root configuration element.

```
xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
```

You can now define include tag's where you want to bring in xml configuration from another file:

```
<xi:include href="my-address-settings.xml"/>
```

You should ensure xml elements in separated files should be namespaced correctly for example if address-settings element was separated, it should have the element namespace defined:

```
 <address-settings xmlns="urn:activemq:core">
```

An example can of this feature can be seen in the test suites:
```
./artemis-server/src/test/resources/ConfigurationTest-xinclude-config.xml
```
**Note:** if you use `xmllint` to validate the XML against the schema you should enable xinclude flag when running.

```
--xinclude
```

For further information on XInclude see:

[https://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude/](https://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude/)

##### Reloading modular configuration files

Certain changes in `broker.xml` can be picked up at runtime as discussed in the [Configuration Reload](config-reload.md)
chapter. Changes made directly to files which are included in `broker.xml` via `xi:include` will not be automatically
picked up unless the file timestamp on `broker.xml` is also modified. For example, if `broker.xml` is including
`my-address-settings.xml` and `my-address-settings.xml` is modified those changes won't be loaded until the user uses
something like the [touch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_%28Unix%29) command to update the `broker.xml` file's
timestamp to trigger a reload.

### System properties

It is possible to use System properties to replace some of the configuration properties. If you define a System property starting with "brokerconfig." that will be passed along to Bean Utils and the configuration would be replaced.

To define global-max-size=1000000 using a system property you would have to define this property, for example through java arguments:

```
java -Dbrokerconfig.globalMaxSize=1000000
```

You can also change the prefix through the `broker.xml` by setting:

```
<system-property-prefix>yourprefix</system-property-prefix>
```

This is to help you customize artemis on embedded systems.


## The core configuration

This describes the root of the XML configuration. You will see here also multiple sub-types listed.
