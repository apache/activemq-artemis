    <title>Messaging Concepts</title>
    <para>ActiveMQ is an asynchronous messaging system, an example of <ulink
            url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_oriented_middleware">Message Oriented
            Middleware</ulink> , we'll just call them messaging systems in the remainder of this
        book.</para>
    <para>We'll first present a brief overview of what kind of things messaging systems do,
        where they're useful and the kind of concepts you'll hear about in the messaging
        world.</para>
    <para>If you're already familiar with what a messaging system is and what it's capable of, then
        you can skip this chapter.</para>
    <section>
        <title>Messaging Concepts</title>
        <para>Messaging systems allow you to loosely couple heterogeneous systems together, whilst
            typically providing reliability, transactions and many other features.</para>
        <para>Unlike systems based on a <ulink
                url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call">Remote Procedure
                Call</ulink> (RPC) pattern, messaging systems primarily use an asynchronous message
            passing pattern with no tight relationship between requests and responses. Most
            messaging systems also support a request-response mode but this is not a primary feature
            of messaging systems.</para>
        <para>Designing systems to be asynchronous from end-to-end allows you to really take
            advantage of your hardware resources, minimizing the amount of threads blocking on IO
            operations, and to use your network bandwidth to its full capacity. With an RPC approach
            you have to wait for a response for each request you make so are limited by the network
            round trip time, or <emphasis role="italic">latency</emphasis> of your network. With an
            asynchronous system you can pipeline flows of messages in different directions, so are
            limited by the network <emphasis role="italic">bandwidth</emphasis> not the latency.
            This typically allows you to create much higher performance applications.</para>
        <para>Messaging systems decouple the senders of messages from the consumers of messages. The
            senders and consumers of messages are completely independent and know nothing of each
            other. This allows you to create flexible, loosely coupled systems.</para>
        <para>Often, large enterprises use a messaging system to implement a message bus which
            loosely couples heterogeneous systems together. Message buses often form the core of an
                <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_service_bus">Enterprise Service
                Bus</ulink>. (ESB). Using a message bus to de-couple disparate systems can allow the
            system to grow and adapt more easily. It also allows more flexibility to add new systems
            or retire old ones since they don't have brittle dependencies on each other.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Messaging styles</title>
        <para>Messaging systems normally support two main styles of asynchronous messaging: <ulink
                url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_queue"> message queue</ulink> messaging
            (also known as <emphasis role="italic">point-to-point messaging</emphasis>) and <ulink
                url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish_subscribe">publish subscribe</ulink>
            messaging. We'll summarise them briefly here:</para>
        <section>
            <title>The Message Queue Pattern</title>
            <para>With this type of messaging you send a message to a queue. The message is then
                typically persisted to provide a guarantee of delivery, then some time later the
                messaging system delivers the message to a consumer. The consumer then processes the
                message and when it is done, it acknowledges the message. Once the message is
                acknowledged it disappears from the queue and is not available to be delivered
                again. If the system crashes before the messaging server receives an acknowledgement
                from the consumer, then on recovery, the message will be available to be delivered
                to a consumer again.</para>
            <para>With point-to-point messaging, there can be many consumers on the queue but a
                particular message will only ever be consumed by a maximum of one of them. Senders
                (also known as<emphasis role="italic"> producers</emphasis>) to the queue are
                completely decoupled from receivers (also known as <emphasis role="italic"
                    >consumers</emphasis>) of the queue - they do not know of each other's
                existence.</para>
            <para>A classic example of point to point messaging would be an order queue in a
                company's book ordering system. Each order is represented as a message which is sent
                to the order queue. Let's imagine there are many front end ordering systems which
                send orders to the order queue. When a message arrives on the queue it is persisted
                - this ensures that if the server crashes the order is not lost. Let's also imagine
                there are many consumers on the order queue - each representing an instance of an
                order processing component - these can be on different physical machines but
                consuming from the same queue. The messaging system delivers each message to one and
                only one of the ordering processing components. Different messages can be processed
                by different order processors, but a single order is only processed by one order
                processor - this ensures orders aren't processed twice.</para>
            <para>As an order processor receives a message, it fulfills the order, sends order
                information to the warehouse system and then updates the order database with the
                order details. Once it's done that it acknowledges the message to tell the server
                that the order has been processed and can be forgotten about. Often the send to the
                warehouse system, update in database and acknowledgement will be completed in a
                single transaction to ensure <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID"
                    >ACID</ulink> properties.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>The Publish-Subscribe Pattern</title>
            <para>With publish-subscribe messaging many senders can send messages to an entity on
                the server, often called a <emphasis role="italic">topic</emphasis> (e.g. in the JMS
                world).</para>
            <para>There can be many <emphasis>subscriptions</emphasis> on a topic, a subscription is
                just another word for a consumer of a topic. Each subscription receives a
                    <emphasis>copy</emphasis> of <emphasis role="italic">each</emphasis> message
                sent to the topic. This differs from the message queue pattern where each message is
                only consumed by a single consumer.</para>
            <para>Subscriptions can optionally be <emphasis role="italic">durable</emphasis> which
                means they retain a copy of each message sent to the topic until the subscriber
                consumes them - even if the server crashes or is restarted in between. Non-durable
                subscriptions only last a maximum of the lifetime of the connection that created
                them.</para>
            <para>An example of publish-subscribe messaging would be a news feed. As news articles
                are created by different editors around the world they are sent to a news feed
                topic. There are many subscribers around the world who are interested in receiving
                news items - each one creates a subscription and the messaging system ensures that a
                copy of each news message is delivered to each subscription.</para>
        </section>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Delivery guarantees</title>
        <para>A key feature of most messaging systems is <emphasis role="italic">reliable
                messaging</emphasis>. With reliable messaging the server gives a guarantee that the
            message will be delivered once and only once to each consumer of a queue or each durable
            subscription of a topic, even in the event of system failure. This is crucial for many
            businesses; e.g. you don't want your orders fulfilled more than once or any of your
            orders to be lost.</para>
        <para>In other cases you may not care about a once and only once delivery guarantee and are
            happy to cope with duplicate deliveries or lost messages - an example of this might be
            transient stock price updates - which are quickly superseded by the next update on the
            same stock. The messaging system allows you to configure which delivery guarantees you
            require.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Transactions</title>
        <para>Messaging systems typically support the sending and acknowledgement of multiple
            messages in a single local transaction. ActiveMQ also supports the sending and
            acknowledgement of message as part of a large global transaction - using the Java
            mapping of XA: JTA.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Durability</title>
        <para>Messages are either durable or non durable. Durable messages will be persisted in
            permanent storage and will survive server failure or restart. Non durable messages will
            not survive server failure or restart. Examples of durable messages might be orders or
            trades, where they cannot be lost. An example of a non durable message might be a stock
            price update which is transitory and doesn't need to survive a restart.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Messaging APIs and protocols</title>
        <para>How do client applications interact with messaging systems in order to send and
            consume messages?</para>
        <para>Several messaging systems provide their own proprietary APIs with which the client
            communicates with the messaging system.</para>
        <para>There are also some standard ways of operating with messaging systems and some
            emerging standards in this space.</para>
        <para>Let's take a brief look at these:</para>
        <section>
            <title>Java Message Service (JMS)</title>
            <para><ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Message_Service">JMS</ulink> is part
                of Sun's JEE specification. It's a Java API that encapsulates both message queue and
                publish-subscribe messaging patterns. JMS is a lowest common denominator
                specification - i.e. it was created to encapsulate common functionality of the
                already existing messaging systems that were available at the time of its
                creation.</para>
            <para>JMS is a very popular API and is implemented by most messaging systems. JMS is
                only available to clients running Java.</para>
            <para>JMS does not define a standard wire format - it only defines a programmatic API so
                JMS clients and servers from different vendors cannot directly interoperate since
                each will use the vendor's own internal wire protocol.</para>
            <para>ActiveMQ provides a fully compliant JMS 1.1 and JMS 2.0 API.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>System specific APIs</title>
            <para>Many systems provide their own programmatic API for which to interact with the
                messaging system. The advantage of this it allows the full set of system
                functionality to be exposed to the client application. API's like JMS are not
                normally rich enough to expose all the extra features that most messaging systems
                provide.</para>
            <para>ActiveMQ provides its own core client API for clients to use if they wish to have
                access to functionality over and above that accessible via the JMS API.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>RESTful API</title>
            <para><ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer"
                    >REST</ulink> approaches to messaging are showing a lot interest
                recently.</para>
            <para>It seems plausible that API standards for cloud computing may converge on a REST
                style set of interfaces and consequently a REST messaging approach is a very strong
                contender for becoming the de-facto method for messaging interoperability.</para>
            <para>With a REST approach messaging resources are manipulated as resources defined by a
                URI and typically using a simple set of operations on those resources, e.g. PUT,
                POST, GET etc. REST approaches to messaging often use HTTP as their underlying
                protocol.</para>
            <para>The advantage of a REST approach with HTTP is in its simplicity and the fact the
                internet is already tuned to deal with HTTP optimally.</para>
            <para>Please see <xref linkend="rest"/> for using ActiveMQ's RESTful interface.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>STOMP</title>
            <para><ulink
                    url="http://stomp.github.io/"
                    >Stomp</ulink> is a very simple text protocol for interoperating with messaging
                systems. It defines a wire format, so theoretically any Stomp client can work with
                any messaging system that supports Stomp. Stomp clients are available in many
                different programming languages.</para>
            <para>Please see <xref linkend="stomp"/> for using STOMP with ActiveMQ.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>AMQP</title>
            <para><ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMQP">AMQP</ulink> is a specification for
                interoperable messaging. It also defines a wire format, so any AMQP client can work
                with any messaging system that supports AMQP. AMQP clients are available in many
                different programming languages.</para>
            <para>ActiveMQ implements the <ulink url="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=amqp">AMQP 1.0</ulink>
            specification. Any client that supports the 1.0 specification will be able to interact with ActiveMQ.</para>
         </section>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>High Availability</title>
        <para>High Availability (HA) means that the system should remain operational after failure
            of one or more of the servers. The degree of support for HA varies between various
            messaging systems.</para>
        <para>ActiveMQ provides automatic failover where your sessions are automatically reconnected
            to the backup server on event of live server failure.</para>
        <para>For more information on HA, please see <xref linkend="ha"/>.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Clusters</title>
        <para>Many messaging systems allow you to create groups of messaging servers called
                <emphasis role="italic">clusters</emphasis>. Clusters allow the load of sending and
            consuming messages to be spread over many servers. This allows your system to scale
            horizontally by adding new servers to the cluster.</para>
        <para>Degrees of support for clusters varies between messaging systems, with some systems
            having fairly basic clusters with the cluster members being hardly aware of each
            other.</para>
        <para>ActiveMQ provides very configurable state-of-the-art clustering model where messages
            can be intelligently load balanced between the servers in the cluster, according to the
            number of consumers on each node, and whether they are ready for messages.</para>
        <para>ActiveMQ also has the ability to automatically redistribute messages between nodes of a
            cluster to prevent starvation on any particular node.</para>
        <para>For full details on clustering, please see <xref linkend="clusters"/>.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Bridges and routing</title>
        <para>Some messaging systems allow isolated clusters or single nodes to be bridged together,
            typically over unreliable connections like a wide area network (WAN), or the
            internet.</para>
        <para>A bridge normally consumes from a queue on one server and forwards messages to another
            queue on a different server. Bridges cope with unreliable connections, automatically
            reconnecting when the connections becomes available again.</para>
        <para>ActiveMQ bridges can be configured with filter expressions to only forward certain
            messages, and transformation can also be hooked in.</para>
        <para>ActiveMQ also allows routing between queues to be configured in server side
            configuration. This allows complex routing networks to be set up forwarding or copying
            messages from one destination to another, forming a global network of interconnected
            brokers.</para>
        <para>For more information please see <xref linkend="core-bridges"/> and <xref
                linkend="diverts"/>.</para>
