   <title>Intercepting Operations</title>
   <para>HornetQ supports <emphasis>interceptors</emphasis> to intercept packets entering
       and exiting the server. Incoming and outgoing interceptors are be called for any packet
       entering or exiting the server respectively. This allows custom code to be executed,
       e.g. for auditing packets, filtering or other reasons. Interceptors can change the
       packets they intercept. This makes interceptors powerful, but also potentially
       dangerous.</para>
   <section>
      <title>Implementing The Interceptors</title>
      <para>An interceptor must implement the <literal>Interceptor interface</literal>:</para>
      <programlisting>
package org.apache.activemq6.api.core.interceptor;

public interface Interceptor
{   
   boolean intercept(Packet packet, RemotingConnection connection) throws HornetQException;
}</programlisting>
      <para>The returned boolean value is important:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
         <listitem>
            <para>if <literal>true</literal> is returned, the process continues normally</para>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <para>if <literal>false</literal> is returned, the process is aborted, no other interceptors
                will be called and the packet will not be processed further by the server.</para>
         </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
   </section>
   <section>
      <title>Configuring The Interceptors</title>
      <para>Both incoming and outgoing interceptors are configured in
          <literal>hornetq-configuration.xml</literal>:</para>
      <programlisting>
&lt;remoting-incoming-interceptors>
   &lt;class-name>org.apache.activemq6.jms.example.LoginInterceptor&lt;/class-name>
   &lt;class-name>org.apache.activemq6.jms.example.AdditionalPropertyInterceptor&lt;/class-name>
&lt;/remoting-incoming-interceptors></programlisting>
      <programlisting>
&lt;remoting-outgoing-interceptors>
   &lt;class-name>org.apache.activemq6.jms.example.LogoutInterceptor&lt;/class-name>
   &lt;class-name>org.apache.activemq6.jms.example.AdditionalPropertyInterceptor&lt;/class-name>
&lt;/remoting-outgoing-interceptors></programlisting>
      <para>The interceptors classes (and their dependencies) must be added to the server classpath
         to be properly instantiated and called.</para>
   </section>
   <section>
      <title>Interceptors on the Client Side</title>
      <para>The interceptors can also be run on the client side to intercept packets either sent by the
         client to the server or by the server to the client. This is done by adding the interceptor to
         the <code>ServerLocator</code> with the <code>addIncomingInterceptor(Interceptor)</code> or
         <code>addOutgoingInterceptor(Interceptor)</code> methods.</para>
      <para>As noted above, if an interceptor returns <literal>false</literal> then the sending of the
         packet is aborted which means that no other interceptors are be called and the packet is not
         be processed further by the client. Typically this process happens transparently to the client
         (i.e. it has no idea if a packet was aborted or not). However, in the case of an outgoing packet
         that is sent in a <literal>blocking</literal> fashion a <literal>HornetQException</literal> will
         be thrown to the caller. The exception is thrown because blocking sends provide reliability and
         it is considered an error for them not to succeed. <literal>Blocking</literal> sends occurs when,
         for example, an application invokes <literal>setBlockOnNonDurableSend(true)</literal> or
         <literal>setBlockOnDurableSend(true)</literal> on its <literal>ServerLocator</literal> or if an
         application is using a JMS connection factory retrieved from JNDI that has either
         <literal>block-on-durable-send</literal> or <literal>block-on-non-durable-send</literal>
         set to <literal>true</literal>. Blocking is also used for packets dealing with transactions (e.g.
         commit, roll-back, etc.). The <literal>HornetQException</literal> thrown will contain the name
         of the interceptor that returned false.</para>
      <para>As on the server, the client interceptor classes (and their dependencies) must be added to the classpath
         to be properly instantiated and invoked.</para>

         shows how to use interceptors to add properties to a message on the server.</para>
