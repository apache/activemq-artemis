# Routing Messages With Wild Cards

Apache ActiveMQ Artemis allows the routing of messages via wildcard addresses.

If a queue is created with an address of say `queue.news.#` then it will
receive any messages sent to addresses that match this, for instance
`queue.news.europe` or `queue.news.usa` or `queue.news.usa.sport`. If
you create a consumer on this queue, this allows a consumer to consume
messages which are sent to a *hierarchy* of addresses.

> **Note**
>
> In JMS terminology this allows "topic hierarchies" to be created.

This functionality is enabled by default. To turn it off add the following to the `broker.xml` configuration.

      <wildcard-addresses>
        <routing-enabled>false</routing-enabled>
      </wildcard-addresses>

For more information on the wild card syntax and how to configure it, take a look at [wildcard syntax](wildcard-syntax.md) chapter,
also see the topic hierarchy example in the [examples](examples.md).
