    <title>Detecting Dead Connections</title>
    <para>In this section we will discuss connection time-to-live (TTL) and explain how HornetQ
        deals with crashed clients and clients which have exited without cleanly closing their
        resources.</para>
    <section id="dead.connections">
        <title>Cleaning up Dead Connection Resources on the Server</title>
        <para>Before a HornetQ client application exits it is considered good practice that it
            should close its resources in a controlled manner, using a <literal>finally</literal>
            block.</para>
        <para>Here's an example of a well behaved core client application closing its session and
            session factory in a finally block:</para>
        <programlisting>
ServerLocator locator = null;
ClientSessionFactory sf = null;
ClientSession session = null;

try
{
   locator = HornetQClient.createServerLocatorWithoutHA(..);

   sf = locator.createClientSessionFactory();;

   session = sf.createSession(...);
   
   ... do some stuff with the session...
}
finally
{
   if (session != null)
   {
      session.close();
   }
   
   if (sf != null)
   {
      sf.close();
   }

   if(locator != null)
   {
      locator.close();
   }
}</programlisting>
        <para>And here's an example of a well behaved JMS client application:</para>
        <programlisting>
Connection jmsConnection = null;

try
{
   ConnectionFactory jmsConnectionFactory = HornetQJMSClient.createConnectionFactoryWithoutHA(...);

   jmsConnection = jmsConnectionFactory.createConnection();

   ... do some stuff with the connection...
}
finally
{
   if (connection != null)
   {
      connection.close();
   }
}</programlisting>
        <para>Unfortunately users don't always write well behaved applications, and sometimes
            clients just crash so they don't have a chance to clean up their resources!</para>
        <para>If this occurs then it can leave server side resources, like sessions, hanging on the
            server. If these were not removed they would cause a resource leak on the server and
            over time this result in the server running out of memory or other resources.</para>
        <para>We have to balance the requirement for cleaning up dead client resources with the fact
            that sometimes the network between the client and the server can fail and then come
            back, allowing the client to reconnect. HornetQ supports client reconnection, so we
            don't want to clean up "dead" server side resources too soon or this will prevent any
            client from reconnecting, as it won't be able to find its old sessions on the
            server.</para>
        <para>HornetQ makes all of this configurable. For each <literal
                >ClientSessionFactory</literal> we define a <emphasis>connection TTL</emphasis>.
            Basically, the TTL determines how long the server will keep a connection alive in the
            absence of any data arriving from the client. The client will automatically send "ping"
            packets periodically to prevent the server from closing it down. If the server doesn't
            receive any packets on a connection for the connection TTL time, then it will
            automatically close all the sessions on the server that relate to that
            connection.</para>
        <para>If you're using JMS, the connection TTL is defined by the <literal
                >ConnectionTTL</literal> attribute on a <literal>HornetQConnectionFactory</literal>
            instance, or if you're deploying JMS connection factory instances direct into JNDI on
            the server side, you can specify it in the xml config, using the parameter <literal
                >connection-ttl</literal>.</para>
        <para>The default value for connection ttl on an "unreliable" connection (e.g. a Netty
            connection) is <literal>60000</literal>ms, i.e. 1 minute. The default value for connection
            ttl on a "reliable" connection (e.g. an in-vm connection) is <literal>-1</literal>. A
            value of <literal>-1</literal> for <literal>ConnectionTTL</literal> means the server
            will never time out the connection on the server side.</para>
        <para id="connection-ttl.override">If you do not wish clients to be able to specify their own connection TTL, you can
            override all values used by a global value set on the server side. This can be done by
            specifying the <literal>connection-ttl-override</literal> attribute in the server side
            configuration. The default value for <literal>connection-ttl-override</literal> is
                <literal>-1</literal> which means "do not override" (i.e. let clients use their own
            values).</para>
        <section>
            <title>Closing core sessions or JMS connections that you have failed to close</title>
            <para>As previously discussed, it's important that all core client sessions and JMS
                connections are always closed explicitly in a <literal>finally</literal> block when
                you are finished using them. </para>
            <para>If you fail to do so, HornetQ will detect this at garbage collection time, and log
                a warning similar to the following in the logs (If you are using JMS the warning
                will involve a JMS connection not a client session):</para>
            <programlisting>
[Finalizer] 20:14:43,244 WARNING [org.apache.activemq.core.client.impl.DelegatingSession]  I'm closing a ClientSession you left open. Please make sure you close all ClientSessions explicitly before let
ting them go out of scope!
[Finalizer] 20:14:43,244 WARNING [org.apache.activemq.core.client.impl.DelegatingSession]  The session you didn't close was created here:
java.lang.Exception
   at org.apache.activemq.core.client.impl.DelegatingSession.&lt;init>(DelegatingSession.java:83)
   at org.acme.yourproject.YourClass (YourClass.java:666)</programlisting>
            <para>HornetQ will then close the connection / client session for you.</para>
            <para>Note that the log will also tell you the exact line of your user code where you
                created the JMS connection / client session that you later did not close. This will
                enable you to pinpoint the error in your code and correct it appropriately.</para>
        </section>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Detecting failure from the client side.</title>
        <para>In the previous section we discussed how the client sends pings to the server and how
            "dead" connection resources are cleaned up by the server. There's also another reason
            for pinging, and that's for the <emphasis>client</emphasis> to be able to detect that
            the server or network has failed.</para>
        <para>As long as the client is receiving data from the server it will consider the
            connection to be still alive. </para>
        <para>If the client does not receive any packets for <literal
                >client-failure-check-period</literal> milliseconds then it will consider the
            connection failed and will either initiate failover, or call any <literal
                >FailureListener</literal> instances (or <literal>ExceptionListener</literal>
            instances if you are using JMS) depending on how it has been configured.</para>
        <para>If you're using JMS it's defined by the <literal>ClientFailureCheckPeriod</literal>
            attribute on a <literal>HornetQConnectionFactory</literal> instance, or if you're
            deploying JMS connection factory instances direct into JNDI on the server side, you can
            specify it in the <literal>hornetq-jms.xml </literal> configuration file, using the
            parameter <literal>client-failure-check-period</literal>.</para>
        <para>The default value for client failure check period on an "unreliable" connection (e.g.
            a Netty connection) is <literal>30000</literal>ms, i.e. 30 seconds. The default value
            for client failure check period on a "reliable" connection (e.g. an in-vm connection)
            is <literal>-1</literal>. A value of <literal>-1</literal> means the client will never fail the
            connection on the client side if no data is received from the server. Typically this is
            much lower than connection TTL to allow clients to reconnect in case of transitory
            failure.</para>
    </section>
    <section id="connection-ttl.async-connection-execution">
        <title>Configuring Asynchronous Connection Execution</title>
        <para>Most packets received on the server side are executed on the remoting thread. These packets
            represent short-running operations and are always executed on the remoting thread for
            performance reasons.</para>
        <para>However, by default some kinds of packets are executed using a thread from a
            thread pool so that the remoting thread is not tied up for too long. Please note that
            processing operations asynchronously on another thread adds a little more latency. These packets
            are:</para>
