# Configuration Reload

The system will perform a periodic check on the configuration files, configured by `configuration-file-refresh-period`, with the default at 5000, in milliseconds.

Once the configuration file is changed (broker.xml) the following modules will be reloaded automatically:

- Address Settings
- Security Settings
- Diverts
- Addresses & queues


Notice: 

Deletion of Address's and Queue's, not auto created is controlled by Address Settings

* config-delete-addresses
   * OFF (DEFAULT) - will not remove upon config reload.
   * FORCE - will remove the address and its queues upon config reload, even if messages remains, losing the messages in the address & queues.

* config-delete-queues
   * OFF (DEFAULT) - will not remove upon config reload.
   * FORCE - will remove the queue upon config reload, even if messages remains, losing the messages in the queue.


By default both settings are OFF as such address & queues won't be removed upon reload, given the risk of losing messages. 

When OFF You may execute explicit CLI or Management operations to remove address & queues.

## Configuration Parameters that are reloaded at runtime

The broker configuration file has 2 main parts, `<core>` and `<jms>`. Some of the parameters in the 2 parts are monitored and, 
if modified, reloaded into the broker at runtime.

Please note that elements under `<jms>` are deprecated. Users are encouraged to use `<core>` configuration entities.

> *Note:*
> Most parameters reloaded take effect immediately after reloading. However there are some 
> that won’t take any effect unless you restarting the broker.
> Such parameters are specifically indicated in the following text.

### Parameters in `<core>` that can be reloaded at runtime

#### Parameters under `<security-settings>`

* `<security-setting>` element

Changes to any <security-setting> elements will be reloaded. Each <security-setting> defines security roles for a matched address. 

   * The `match` attribute

   This attribute defines the address for which the security-setting is defined. It can take wildcards such as ‘#’ and ‘*’.  

   * The `<permission>` sub-elements

   Each `<security-setting>` can have a list of `<permission>` elements, each of which defines a specific permission-roles mapping. 
   Each permission has 2 attributes ‘type’ and ‘roles’. The ‘type’ attribute defines the type of operation allowed, the ‘roles’ 
   defines which roles are allowed to perform such operation. Refer to the user’s manual for a list of operations that can be defined.

> *Note:*
> Once loaded the security-settings will take effect immediately. Any new clients will subject
> to the new security settings. Any existing clients will subject to the new settings as well, as soon as they performs
> a new security-sensitive operation.

Below lists the effects of adding, deleting and updating of an element/attribute within the `<security-settings>` element, whether
an change can be done or can’t be done.

Operation | Add | Delete | Update
:--- | :--- | :--- | :---
`<security-settings>` | X* (at most one element is allowed) | Deleting it means delete the whole security settings from the running broker. | N/A*
`<security-setting>` | Adding one element means adding a new set of security roles for an address in the running broker | Deleting one element means removing a set of security roles for an address in the running broker | Updating one element means updating the security roles for an address (if match attribute is not changed), or means removing the old match address settings and adding a new one (if match attribute is changed)
attribute `match` | N/A* | X* | Changing this value is same as deleting the whole <security-setting> with the old match value and adding
`<permission>` | Adding one means adding  a new permission definition to runtime broker | Deleting a permission from the runtime broker | Updating a permission-roles in the runtime broker
attribute `type` | N/A* | X* | Changing the type value means remove the permission of the old one and add the permission of this type to the running broker.
attribute `roles` | N/A* | X* | Changing the ‘roles’ value means updating the permission’s allowed roles to the running broker

> * `N/A` means this operation is not applicable.
> * `X` means this operation is not allowed.

#### Parameters under `<address-settings>`

* `<address-settings>` element

Changes to elements under `<address-settings>` will be reloaded into runtime broker. It contains a list of `<address-setting>` elements.

   * `<address-setting>` element
   
   Each address-setting element has a ‘match’ attribute that defines an address pattern for which this address-setting is defined. It also has a list of sub-elements used to define the properties of a matching address.
   
   > *Note:*
   > Parameters reloaded in this category will take effect immediately after reloading. The effect of deletion of Address's and Queue's, 
   > not auto created is controlled by parameter `config-delete-addresses` and `config-delete-queues` as described in the doc.
