= Resource Limits
:idprefix:
:idseparator: -

Sometimes it's helpful to set particular limits on what certain users can do beyond the normal security settings related to authorization and  authentication.
For example, limiting how many connections a user can create or how many queues a user can create.
This chapter will explain how to  configure such limits.

== Configuring Limits Via Resource Limit Settings

Here is an example of the XML used to set resource limits:

[,xml]
----
<resource-limit-settings>
   <resource-limit-setting match="myUser">
      <max-sessions>5</max-sessions>
      <max-queues>3</max-queues>
   </resource-limit-setting>
</resource-limit-settings>
----

Unlike the `match` from `address-setting`, this `match` does not use any wild-card syntax.
It's a simple 1:1 mapping of the limits to a *user*.

max-sessions::
How many sessions the matched user can create on the broker.
The default is -1 which means there is no limit.

.Why _sessions_ and not _connections_?
****
The _session_ is the fundamental networked resource in the Core API.

There is no conceptual separation between a _connection_ and a _session_ in the Core API as there is, for example, in JMS/Jakarta Messaging.
When an application uses the Core JMS implementation to create a JMS `Connection` what's actually created behind-the-scenes is a Core session.
This session is used to validate the client application's credentials and JMS client ID (if available).
When the application creates a JMS `Session` then another Core session is created.

The same basic thing happens for the other supported protocols (e.g. STOMP, AMQP, MQTT). When a client creates a network connection to the broker the broker responds by creating an internal, server-side session.

The number of these sessions can be limited on a per-user basis.

To be clear, the broker _does_ track basic TCP connections, and these too can be limited (i.e. via the `connectionsAllowed` acceptor URL parameter), but these connections don't carry credentials and therefore cannot be limited on a per-user basis.
****
max-queues::
How many queues the matched user can create.
The default is -1 which means there is no limit.
