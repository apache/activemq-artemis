History
=======

The Apache ActiveMQ Artemis project was started in October 2014. The Artemis code base was seeded with a code donation granted by Red Hat, of the HornetQ project. The code donation process consisted of taking a snapshot of the latest HornetQ code base and contributing this snapshot as an [initial git commit](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARTEMIS-1) into the Artemis git repository.

The HornetQ commit history is preserved and can be accessed here: [https://github.com/hornetq/hornetq/tree/apache-donation](https://github.com/hornetq/hornetq/tree/apache-donation)
