= Code Formatting

== IDEA

If you completed the step described on xref:_ide.adoc#style-templates-and-inspection-settings-for-idea[idea instructions], and selected the code style accordingly you should be ready to go.

== Eclipse

Eclipse code formatting and (basic) project configuration files can be found at the `etc/` folder.
You should manually  copy them _after importing all your projects_:
[,console]
----
for settings_dir in `find . -type d -name .settings`; do
\cp -v etc/ide-settings/eclipse/org.eclipse.jdt.* $settings_dir
done
----
Do not use the https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-eclipse-plugin/[maven-eclipse-plugin] to copy the files as it  conflicts with https://eclipse.org/m2e/[m2e].

== EditorConfig

For editors supporting http://editorconfig.org/[EditorConfig], a settings file is provided in etc/ide-settings/editorconfig.ini.
Copy it to your Artemis top level directory and http://editorconfig.org/#file-location[name it .editorconfig]
