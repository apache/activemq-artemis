= Notes for Maintainers

Committers have write access to all project repositories and will be responsible for acknowledging and pushing commits contributed via pull requests on GitHub.

Core members are also able to push their own commits directly to the canonical Apache repository.
However, the expectation here is that the developer has made a good effort to test their changes and is reasonably confident that the changes that are being committed will not break the build.

What does it mean to be reasonably confident?
If the developer has run the same maven commands that the pull-request builds are running they can be reasonably confident.
Currently the https://builds.apache.org/job/ActiveMQ-Artemis-PR-Build/[PR build] runs this command:
[,console]
----
$ mvn -Pfast-tests install
----
However, if the changes are significant, touches a wide area of code, or even if the developer just wants a second opinion they are encouraged to engage other members of the community to obtain an additional review prior to pushing.
This can easily be done via a pull request on GitHub, a patch file attached to an email or JIRA, commit to a branch in the Apache git repo, etc.
Having additional eyes looking at significant changes prior to committing to the main development branches is definitely encouraged if it helps obtain the "reasonable confidence" that the build is not broken and code quality has not decreased.

If the build does break then developer is expected to make their best effort to get the builds fixed in a reasonable amount of time.
If it cannot be fixed in a reasonable amount of time the commit can be reverted and re-reviewed.

== Using the `dev` profile.

Developers are encouraged to use the `dev` profile which will activate https://checkstyle.org/[CheckStyle] during the build:
[,console]
----
$ mvn -Pdev install
----
== Commit Messages

Please ensure the commit messages follow the 50/72 format as described xref:_code.adoc#commitMessageDetails[here].
This format follows the recommendation from the https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Contributing-to-a-Project[official Git book].

== Configuring Git repositories

Aside from the traditional `origin` and `upstream` repositories committers will need an additional reference for the canonical Apache git repository where they will be merging and pushing pull-requests.
For the purposes of this document, let's assume these ref/repo associations already exist as described in the xref:code.adoc[Working with the Code] section:

* `origin` : https://github.com/(your-user-name)/activemq-artemis.git
* `upstream` : https://github.com/apache/activemq-artemis

. Add the canonical Apache repository as a remote.
Here we call it `apache`.
+
[,console]
----
$ git remote add apache https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf/activemq-artemis.git
----

. Add the following section to your `<artemis-repo>/.git/config` statement to fetch all pull requests sent to the GitHub mirror.
We are using `upstream` as the remote repo name (as noted above), but the remote repo name may be different if you choose.
Just be sure to edit all references to the remote repo name so it's consistent.
+
[,console]
----
 [remote "upstream"]
     url = git@github.com:apache/activemq-artemis.git
     fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/upstream/*
     fetch = +refs/pull/*/head:refs/remotes/upstream/pr/*
----

== Merging and pushing pull requests

Here are the basic commands to retrieve pull requests, merge, and push them to the canonical Apache repository:

. Download all the remote branches etc. including all the pull requests.
+
[,console]
----
$ git fetch --all
Fetching origin
Fetching upstream
remote: Counting objects: 566, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (188/188), done.
remote: Total 566 (delta 64), reused 17 (delta 17), pack-reused 351
Receiving objects: 100% (566/566), 300.67 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (78/78), done.
From github.com:apache/activemq-artemis
* [new ref]         refs/pull/105/head -> upstream/pr/105
----
. Checkout the pull request you wish to review
+
[,console]
----
$ git checkout pr/105 -B 105
----
. Rebase the branch against main, so the merge would happen at the top of the current main
+
[,console]
----
$ git pull --rebase apache main
----
. Once you've reviewed the change and are ready to merge checkout `main`.
+
[,console]
----
$ git checkout main
----
. Ensure you are up to date on your main also.
+
[,console]
----
$ git pull --rebase apache main
----
. We actually recommend checking out main again, to make sure you wouldn't add any extra commits by accident:
+
[,console]
----
$ git fetch apache
$ git checkout apache/main -B main
----
. Create a new merge commit from the pull-request.
IMPORTANT: The commit message here should be something like: "This closes #105" where "105" is the pull request ID.
The "#105" shows up as a link in the GitHub UI for navigating to the PR from the commit message.
This will ensure the github pull request is closed even if the commit ID changed due to eventual rebases.
+
[,console]
----
$ git merge --no-ff 105 -m "This closes #105"
----
. Push to the canonical Apache repo.
+
[,console]
----
$ git push apache main
----

== Using the automated script

If you followed the naming conventions described here you can use the `scripts/rebase-PR.sh` script to automate the merging process.
This will execute the exact steps described on this previous section.

* Simply use:
+
[,console]
----
$ <checkout-directory>/scripts/merge-pr.sh <PR number> Message on the PR
----
Example:
+
[,console]
----
$ pwd
/checkouts/apache-activemq-artemis

$ ./scripts/merge-PR.sh 175 ARTEMIS-229 address on Security Interface
----
+
The previous example was taken from a real case that generated this https://github.com/apache/activemq-artemis/commit/e85bb3ca4a75b0f1dfbe717ff90b34309e2de794[merge commit on #175].

* After this you can push to the canonical Apache repo.
+
[,console]
----
$ git push apache main
----

== Use a separate branch for your changes

It is recommended that you work away from main for two reasons:

. When you send a PR, your PR branch could be rebased during the process and your commit ID changed.
You might get unexpected conflicts while rebasing your old branch.
. You could end up pushing things upstream that you didn't intend to.
Minimize your risks by working on a branch away from main.

== Notes

The GitHub mirror repository (i.e. `upstream`) is cloning the canonical Apache repository.
Because of this there may be a slight delay between when a commit is pushed to the Apache repo and when that commit is reflected in the GitHub mirror.
This may cause some difficulty when trying to push a PR to `apache` that has been merged on the out-of-date GitHub mirror.
You can wait for the mirror to update before performing the steps above or you can change your local main branch to track the main branch on the canonical Apache repository rather than the main branch on the GitHub mirror:

[,console]
----
$ git branch main -u apache/main
----
Where `apache` points to the canonical Apache repository.

If you'd like your local main branch to always track `upstream/main` (i.e. the GitHub mirror) then another way to achieve this is to add another branch that tracks `apache/main` and push from that branch e.g.

[,console]
----
$ git checkout main
$ git branch apache_main --track apache/main
$ git pull
$ git merge --no-ff pr/105
$ git push
----
