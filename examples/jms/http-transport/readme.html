     <h1>JMS HTTP Example</h1>


     <pre>To run the example, simply type <b>mvn verify</b> from this directory, <br>or <b>mvn -PnoServer verify</b> if you want to start and create the server manually.</pre>

     <p>This example shows you how to configure ActiveMQ Artemis to use the HTTP protocol as its transport layer.</p>

     <p>ActiveMQ Artemis supports a variety of network protocols to be its underlying transport without any specific code change.</p>

     <p>This example is taken from the queue example without any code change. By changing the configuration file, one can get ActiveMQ Artemis working with HTTP transport.</p>
     <p>All you need to do is open the server0/broker.xml and enable HTTP like the following</p>


      <pre class="prettyprint">
      <code>
      &lt;connector name=&quot;netty-connector&quot;&gt;tcp://localhost:8080?httpEnabled=true&lt;/connector&gt;

      &lt;!-- Acceptors --&gt;

      &lt;acceptor name=&quot;netty-acceptor&quot;&gt;tcp://localhost:8080 &lt;/acceptor&gt;
      </code>
      </pre>
