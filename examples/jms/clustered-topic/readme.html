     <h1>JMS Clustered Topic Example</h1>
     <pre>To run the example, simply type <b>mvn verify</b> from this directory, <br>or <b>mvn -PnoServer verify</b> if you want to start and create the server manually.</pre>

     <p>This example demonstrates a JMS Topic deployed on two different nodes. The two nodes are configured to form a cluster.</p>
     <p>We then create a subscriber on the topic on each node, and we create a producer on only one of the nodes.</p>
     <p>We then send some messages via the producer, and we verify that <b>both</b> subscribers receive all the
     sent messages.</p>
     <p>A JMS Topic is an example of <b>publish-subscribe</b> messaging where all subscribers receive all the
     messages sent to the topic (assuming they have no message selectors).</p>
     <p>This example uses JNDI to lookup the JMS Queue and ConnectionFactory objects. If you prefer not to use
     JNDI, these could be instantiated directly.
     <p>Here's the relevant snippet from the server configuration, which tells the server to form a cluster between the two nodes
     and to load balance the messages between the nodes.</p>
     <pre class="prettyprint">
     <code>&lt;cluster-connection name="my-cluster"&gt;
        &lt;address&gt;jms&lt;/address&gt;
        &lt;retry-interval&gt;500&lt;/retry-interval&gt;
        &lt;use-duplicate-detection&gt;true&lt;/use-duplicate-detection&gt;
        &lt;message-load-balancing&gt;STRICT&lt;/message-load-balancing&gt;
        &lt;max-hops&gt;1&lt;/max-hops&gt;
        &lt;discovery-group-ref discovery-group-name="my-discovery-group"/&gt;
     &lt;/cluster-connection&gt;
     </code>
