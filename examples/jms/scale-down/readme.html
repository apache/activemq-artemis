     <h1>JMS Colocated Failover Shared Store Example</h1>

     <pre>To run the example, simply type <b>mvn verify</b> from this directory.</pre>


     <p>This example demonstrates how you can configure a live server to scale down messages to another live server on shutdown.
     <p>This example starts 2 live servers each one with a connector configured for the other live server.</p>
     <p>The second live server is killed and its messages are scaled down to the first server on shutdown.</p>
     <p>The following shows how to configure the live servers to scale down to one another.</p>
     <pre class="prettyprint">
     <code>
     &lt;ha-policy>
         &lt;live-only>
             &lt;scale-down>
                 &lt;connectors>
                     &lt;connector-ref>server0-connector&lt;/connector-ref>
                 &lt;/connectors>
             &lt;/scale-down>
         &lt;/live-only>
     &lt;/ha-policy>
