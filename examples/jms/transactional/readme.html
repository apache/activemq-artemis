     <h1>JMS Transactional Session Example</h1>

     <pre>To run the example, simply type <b>mvn verify</b> from this directory, <br>or <b>mvn -PnoServer verify</b> if you want to start and create the server manually.</pre>


     <p>This example shows you how to use a transacted Session with ActiveMQ Artemis.</p>
     <p>Firstly 2 messages are sent via the transacted sending session before being committed. This ensures that both message
     are sent</p>
     <p>Secondly the receiving session receives the messages firstly demonstrating a message being redelivered after the session
     being rolled back and then acknowledging receipt of the messages via the commit method.</p>
