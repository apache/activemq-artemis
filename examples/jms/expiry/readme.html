     <h1>JMS Expiration Example</h1>
     <pre>To run the example, simply type <b>mvn verify</b> from this directory, <br>or <b>mvn -PnoServer verify</b> if you want to start and create the server manually.</pre>

     <p>This example shows you how to configure ActiveMQ Artemis so messages are expipired after a certain time.</p>
     <p>Messages can be retained in the messaging system for a limited period of time before being removed.
         JMS specification states that clients should not receive messages that have been expired (but it does not guarantee this will not happen).</p>
     <p>ActiveMQ Artemis can assign a <em>expiry address</em> to a given queue so that when messages are expired, they are removed from the queue and
        routed to this address. These "expired" messages can later be consumed for further inspection.
     <p>
         The example will send 1 message with a short <em>time-to-live</em> to a queue. We will wait for the message to expire and checks that the message
         is no longer in the queue it was sent to.
         We will instead consume it from an <em>expiry queue</em> where it was moved when it expired.
     </p>
     <h2>Example setup</h2>
     <p>Expiry destinations are defined in the configuration file <a href="server0/broker.xml">broker.xml</a>:</p>
     <pre class="prettyprint">
         <code>&lt;address-setting match="jms.queue.exampleQueue"&gt;
            &lt;expiry-address&gt;jms.queue.expiryQueue&lt;/expiry-address&gt;
         &lt;/address-setting&gt;
         </code>
     </pre>
     <p>This configuration will moved expired messages from the <code>exampleQueue</code> to the <code>expiryQueue</code></p>
     <p>ActiveMQ Artemis allows to specify either a <code>Queue</code> by prefixing the <code>expiry-address</code> with <code>jms.queue.</code>
         or a <code>Topic</code> by prefixing with <code>jms.topic.</code>.<br />
         In this example, we will use a <code>Queue</code> to hold the expired messages.</p>
     <p>Since we want to consume messages from this expiryQueue, we also need to add a JNDI binding to perform a lookup.
         This is configured in <a href="server0/activemq-jms.xml">activemq-jms.xml</a></p>
     <pre class="prettyprint">
         <code>&lt;queue name="expiryQueue"&gt;
            &lt;entry name="/queue/expiryQueue"/&gt;
         &lt;/queue&gt;</code>
     </pre>
  </body>
