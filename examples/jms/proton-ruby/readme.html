     <h1>Proton Ruby Example</h1>

     <p>ActiveMQ Artemis can be configured to accept requests from any AMQP client that supports the 1.0 version of the protocol.
     This example shows a simply proton ruby client that sends and receives messages</p>
     <p>To run the example you will need the following packages installed, alsa-lib.i686 libXv.i686 libXScrnSaver.i686 qt.i686 qt-x11.i686 qtwebkit-2.2.2-2.fc18.i686, gcc, ruby</p>
     <p>On fedora you can install these via the <literal>yum install alsa-lib.i686 libXv.i686 libXScrnSaver.i686 qt.i686 qt-x11.i686 qtwebkit-2.2.2-2.fc18.i686, gcc, ruby</literal>
     command</p>
     <p>you will also need the qpid-proton libraries installed, again <literal>yum install qpid-proton</literal></p>
     <p>lastly you wull have to create the gems <literal>gem install qpid_proton</literal></p>

     <p>To configure ActiveMQ Artemis to accept AMQP client connections you need to add an Acceptor like so:</p>
     <pre class="prettyprint">
     <code>
     &lt;acceptor name="proton-acceptor"&gt;tcp://localhost:5672?protocols=AMQP&lt;/acceptor&gt;
     </code>
     </pre>
     <h2>Example step-by-step</h2>
     <p>Firstly start the server by running the command <literal>mvn verify -Pexample</literal></p>
     <p>Then in a separate window you can run the send ruby script by running the command <literal>ruby src/main/scripts/send.rb</literal></p>
     <p>You can then receive the message via the receive ruby script by running <literal>ruby src/main/scripts/receive.rb</literal></p>
