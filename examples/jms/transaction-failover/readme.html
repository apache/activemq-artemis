     <h1>JMS Failover With Transaction Example</h1>

     <pre>To run the example, simply type <b>mvn verify</b> from this directory.</pre>


     <p>This example demonstrates two servers coupled as a live-backup pair for high availability (HA), and a client
     connection failing over from live to backup when the live server is crashed.</p>
     <p>Failover behavior differs whether the JMS session is transacter or not.</p>
     <p>When a <em>transacted</em> JMS session is used, once-and-only once delivery is guaranteed.</p>
     <ul>
        <li>if the failover occurs while there is an in-flight transaction, the transaction will be flagged as <em>rollback only</em>. In that case, the JMS client
           will need to retry the transaction work.</li>
        <li>if the failover occurs while there is <em>no</em> in-flight transaction, the failover will be transparent to the user.</li>
     </ul>
     <p>ActiveMQ Artemis also provides an example for <a href="../non-transactional-failover/readme.html">non-transaction failover</a>.</p>
     <p>For more information on ActiveMQ Artemis failover and HA, and clustering in general, please see the clustering
     section of the user manual.</p>
