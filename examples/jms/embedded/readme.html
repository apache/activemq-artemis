      <h1>Embedded JMS Server Example</h1>
      <pre>To run the example, simply type <b>mvn verify</b> from this directory</pre>

      <p>This examples shows how to setup and run an embedded JMS server using ActiveMQ Artemis.</p>
      <p>ActiveMQ Artemis was designed using POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects) which means embedding ActiveMQ Artemis in your own application
          is as simple as instantiating a few objects.</p>
      <p>This example does not use any configuration files. The server is configured using POJOs and can be easily ported to any dependency injection framework.<br />
         We will setup and run a full-fledged JMS server which binds its JMS resources to JNDI and can be accessed by remote clients.</p>
