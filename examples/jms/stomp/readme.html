     <h1>Stomp Example</h1>

     <pre>To run the example, simply type <b>mvn verify</b> from this directory, <br>or <b>mvn -PnoServer verify</b> if you want to start and create the server manually.</pre>


     <p>This example shows you how to configure ActiveMQ Artemis to send and receive Stomp messages.</p>
     <p>The example will start a ActiveMQ Artemis server configured with Stomp and JMS.</p>
     <p>The client will open a socket to send one Stomp message (using TCP directly).
       The client will then consume a message from a JMS Queue and check it is the message sent with Stomp.</p>
