     <h1>JMS SSL Example</h1>

     <pre>To run the example, simply type <b>mvn verify</b> from this directory, <br>or <b>mvn -PnoServer verify</b> if you want to start and create the server manually.</pre>


     <p>This example shows you how to configure SSL with ActiveMQ Artemis to send and receive message. </p>

     <p>Using SSL can make your messaging applications interact with ActiveMQ Artemis securely. An application can
     be secured transparently without extra coding effort. To secure your messaging application with SSL, you need to configure connector and acceptor as follows:</p>

     <p>
        <pre class="prettyprint">
           <code>
      &lt;!-- Connector --&gt;

      &lt;connector name=&quot;netty-ssl-connector&quot;&gt;tcp://localhost:5500?sslEnabled=true;keyStorePath=activemq/server0/activemq.example.keystore;keyStorePassword=activemqexample&lt;/connector&gt;

      &lt;!-- Acceptor --&gt;

      &lt;acceptor name=&quot;netty-ssl-acceptor&quot;&gt;tcp://localhost:5500?sslEnabled=true;keyStorePath=activemq/server0/activemq.example.keystore;keyStorePassword=activemqexample&lt;/acceptor&gt;

           </code>
        </pre>
     </p>

     <p>In the configuration, the activemq.example.keystore is the key store file holding the server's certificate. The activemq.example.truststore
     is the file holding the certificates which the client trusts (i.e. the server's certificate exported from activemq.example.keystore). They are pre-generated for illustration purpose<a id="fnr1" href="readme.html#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
