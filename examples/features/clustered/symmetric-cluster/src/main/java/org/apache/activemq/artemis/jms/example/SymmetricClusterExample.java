/**
 * This example demonstrates a cluster of three nodes set up in a symmetric topology - i.e. each
 * node is connected to every other node in the cluster. Also each node, has it's own backup node.
 * <p>
 * This is probably the most obvious clustering topology and the one most people will be familiar
 * with from using clustering in an app server, where every node has pretty much identical
 * configuration to every other node.
 * <p>
 * By clustering nodes symmetrically, ActiveMQ Artemis can give the impression of clustered queues, topics
 * and durable subscriptions.
 * <p>
 * In this example we send some messages to a distributed queue and topic and kill all the live
 * servers at different times, and verify that they transparently fail over onto their backup
 * servers.
 * <p>
 * Please see the readme.html file for more information.
