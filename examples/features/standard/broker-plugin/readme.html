     <h1>Broker Plugin Example</h1>
     <pre>To run the example, simply type <b>mvn verify</b> from this directory, <br>or <b>mvn -PnoServer verify</b> if you want to start and create the server manually.</pre>

     <p>AMQP Messages should be by definition immutable at the server's. So, we don't recommend changing message contents.
         However if you require you can use this example as a basis for adding properties on making changes</p>
