      <h1>Embedded Broker with Programmatic Config Example</h1>
      <pre>To run the example, simply type <b>mvn verify</b> from this directory</pre>

      <p>This examples shows how to setup and run an embedded broker using ActiveMQ Artemis.</p>
      <p>ActiveMQ Artemis was designed using POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects) which means embedding ActiveMQ Artemis in your own application
          is as simple as instantiating a few objects.</p>
      <p>This example does not use any configuration files. The server is configured using POJOs and can be easily ported to any dependency injection framework.</p>
