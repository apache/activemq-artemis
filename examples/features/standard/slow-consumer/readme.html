     <h1>JMS Slow Consumer Example</h1>

     <pre>To run the example, simply type <b>mvn verify</b> from this directory, <br>or <b>mvn -PnoServer verify</b> if you want to start and create the server manually.</pre>


     <p>This example demonstrates Slow Consumer policy KILL and NOTIFY and the associated address-settings.</p>
     <p>How often the broker checks for Slow Consumers is configurable by <b>slow-consumer-check-period</b> in the brokers address-settings. The default value is for
         <b>slow-consumer-check-period</b> is 5 seconds. A broker considers a consumer slow if the <b>slow-consumer-threshold</b> is not been met. The
         <b>slow-consumer-threshold</b> is the number of messages consumed by the consumer within a second. When a slow consumer is detected, the broker action depends
         on which <b>slow-consumer-policy</b> is configured.</p>
     <p>The <b>slow-consumer-policy</b> <b>KILL</b> will kill the consumers connection</p>
     <p>The <b>slow-consumer-policy</b> <b>NOTIFY</b> will send a CONSUMER_SLOW management notification that an application can receive</p>

     <p> There are 2 example clients:<p>
     <p><b>KillSlowConsumerExample</b> sends messages to a queue "slow.consumer.kill". It then starts a consumer BUT does not consume any messages. It waits for 8 seconds and tries
         to consume a message. It expects to receive an exception as the connection should already be closed.</p>
     <p><b>NotifySlowConsumerExample</b> sends messages to a queue "slow.consumer.notify". It creates a consumer on the topic "notify.topic" that has been configured as the broker's
         <b>management-notification-address</b>. It then starts a consumer on "slow.consumer.notify" BUT does not consume any messages. The consumer on "notify.topic" will receive a CONSUMER_SLOW management notification
         and then stop the client.</p>
