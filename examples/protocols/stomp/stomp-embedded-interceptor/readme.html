     <h1>Stomp 1.2 Example</h1>

     <pre>To run the example, simply type <b>mvn verify -Pexample</b> from this directory.</pre>

     <p>This example shows you how to configure ActiveMQ Artemis to intercept received Stomp messages.</p>
     <p>The example will start a ActiveMQ Artemis server configured with Stomp and JMS.</p>
     <p>The client will open a socket to initiate a Stomp 1.2 connection and then send one Stomp message (using TCP directly).
       The interceptor will print each message received.</p>
