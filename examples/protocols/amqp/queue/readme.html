<h1>Proton qpid java example</h1>

<pre>To run the example, simply type <b>mvn verify</b> from this directory, <br>or <b>mvn -PnoServer verify</b> if you want to start and create the server manually.</pre>


<<p>ActiveMQ Artemis is a multi protocol broker. It will inspect the initial handshake of clients to determine what protocol to use.</p>
<p>All you need to do is to connect a client into activemq's configured port and you should be able connect.</p>
<p>To run this example simply run the command <literal>mvn verify -Pexample</literal>, execute the compile.sh script and start the executable called ./hello</p>

<p>You don't need to do anything special to configure the ActiveMQ Artemis server to accept AMQP clients. </p>
<p>Just for the sake of documentation though we are setting the port of ActiveMQ Artemis on this example as 5672 which is the port qpid have by default. </p>
<p>This is totally optional and you don't need to follow this convention. You can use any port you chose including ActiveMQ's 61616 default port</p>
