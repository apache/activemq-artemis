# OpenWire JMS Queue Example

To run the example, simply type **mvn verify** from this directory, or **mvn -PnoServer verify** if you want to start and create the broker manually.

This example shows you how to send and receive a message to a JMS queue using ActiveMQ Artemis.

This example does exactly the same as the "queue" example however using the OpenWire client.

Notice this example is using the default configuration.
