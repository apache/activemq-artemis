     <h1>MQTT Example</h1>

     <p>This is a basic MQTT example that demonstrates how to setup and connect to an Apache Artemis broker and
     send and receive messages using the MQTT protocol.</p>

     <h2>Setting up the server</h2>

     <p>This example will use the default out of the box configuration of Artemis you don't need to change anything to run
     this example. Artemis ships with all protocols enabled on port 61616 and also MQTT on port 1883.  To enable MQTT
     on a different port you can add the following XML snippet to the 'acceptors' section of your broker.xml
     configuration file (changing the port from 1883 to what ever you require).</p>


     <pre class="prettyprint">
         <!-- Escaped: <acceptor name="hornetq">tcp://0.0.0.0:1883?protocols=MQTT"></acceptor> -->
         &lt;acceptor name=&quot;hornetq&quot;&gt;tcp://0.0.0.0:1883?protocols=MQTT&quot;&gt;&lt;/acceptor&gt;
     </pre>

     For more information on configuring protocol transports see the "Configuring Transports" section of the user
     manual, specifically the section called "Single Port Support".

     <h2>MQTT Clients</h2>

     <p>There are a number of MQTT client implementations for various languages.  The Paho project:
        http://www.eclipse.org/paho/ offers a number of clients for languages such as C, Python, JavaScript and .Net and
        is also a great resource for all things MQTT.

        This example is actually based on the Fuse MQTT java client and was chosen as it is Apache 2.0 licensed and
        available to download from maven central.  The specific client used in the example is not of importance and is
        used simply to demonstrate the features of MQTT as provided by Apache Artemis.</p>

     <p>If you'd like to use the client demonstrated in this example, simple add the following dependency to your
        pom.xml</p>

     <pre class="prettyprint">
        &lt;dependency&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;org.fusesource.mqtt-client&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;mqtt-client&lt;/artifactId&gt;
            &lt;version&gt;1.10&lt;/version&gt;
        &lt;/dependency&gt;
     </pre>

     <h2>Example Step by Step</h2>

     <o1>
         <li>1. Connect to Artemis</li>

         <p>We start by creating a connection to the Apache Artemis broker.  In this example we specify to use TCP
         protocol on localhost.  By default Apache Artemis will start all protocols on port 61616, so we connect
         to that port.</p>

         <pre class="prettyprint">
             MQTT mqtt = new MQTT();
             mqtt.setHost("tcp://localhost:61616");
             BlockingConnection connection = mqtt.blockingConnection();
             connection.connect();
         </pre>

         <li>2. Create subscriptions</li>

         <p>Subscriptions in MQTT are realised by subscribing to a particular Topic.  Each Topic has an address
         and a quality of service level (QoS level).  Subscriptions also support wildcards.  In the code below we
         subscribe to a Topic with address "mqtt/example/publish" and also a wildcard address "mqtt/#" which will
         match anything starting with "mqtt/".</p>

         <pre class="prettyprint">
             Topic[] topics = { new Topic("mqtt/example/publish", QoS.AT_LEAST_ONCE), new Topic("mqtt/#", QoS.EXACTLY_ONCE) };
             connection.subscribe(topics);
         </pre>

         <li>3. Sending messages</li>

         <p>There is no type system in MQTT, messages simply consist of a number of bytes.  Below we send two messages with
         UTF8 encoded strings (as a byte array).  Notice the second message is sent to "mqtt/test" which should match
         our wildcard subscription we defined previously.</p>

         <pre class="prettyprint">
             String payload1 = "This is message 1";
             String payload2 = "This is message 2";

             connection.publish("mqtt/example/publish", payload1.getBytes(), QoS.AT_LEAST_ONCE, false);
             connection.publish("mqtt/test", payload2.getBytes(), QoS.AT_MOST_ONCE, false);
         </pre>

         <li>4. Receiving messages</li>

         <p>Since we have subscribed to a number of topics and sent messages to them, the client should now receive
         2 messages.  We are not using callbacks here on message receive so we specifically call receive to get
         the messages.  Once we receive the message we convert the payload consisting of bytes back to a UTF8
         encoded string and print the result.</p>

         <pre class="prettyprint">
             Message message1 = connection.receive(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
             Message message2 = connection.receive(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

             System.out.println(new String(message1.getPayload()));
             System.out.println(new String(message2.getPayload()));
         </pre>
     </o1>

     <h2>Result</h2>
     This example has shown you how to set up the basics of MQTT including how to connect to the Artemis broker and
     how to send and receive messages including subscriptions using wildcard addresses.
