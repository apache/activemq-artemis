     <h1>JMS QueueRequestor Example</h1>

     <pre>To run the example, simply type <b>mvn verify</b> from this directory, <br>or <b>mvn -PnoServer verify</b> if you want to start and create the server manually.</pre>


     <p>This example shows you how to use a <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/jms/QueueRequestor.html">QueueRequestor</a> with ActiveMQ Artemis.</p>
     <p>JMS is mainly used to send messages asynchronously so that the producer of a message is not waiting for the result of the message consumption.
        However, there are cases where it is necessary to have a synchronous behavior: the code sending a message requires a reply for this message
        before continuing its execution.<br />
        A QueueRequestor facilitates this use case by providing a simple request/reply abstraction on top of JMS.</p>
     <p>The example consists in two classes:</p>
     <dl>
         <dt><code>TextReverserService</code></dt>
         <dd>A JMS MessageListener which consumes text messages and sends replies containing the reversed text</dd>
         <dt><code>QueueRequestorExample</code></dt>
         <dd>A JMS Client which uses a QueueRequestor to send text requests to a queue and receive replies with the reversed text in a synchronous fashion</dd>
    </dl>
