     <h1>JMS Multiple Failover using Replication Example</h1>

     <pre>To run the example, simply type <b>mvn verify</b> from this directory.</pre>

     <p>This example demonstrates three servers coupled as a live-backup-backup group for high availability (HA) using replication, and a client
     connection failing over from live to backup when the live server is crashed and then to the second backup once the new live fails.</p>

     <p>For more information on ActiveMQ Artemis failover and HA, and clustering in general, please see the clustering
     section of the user manual.</p>
