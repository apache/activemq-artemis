/**
 * Fulfilled by client or Netty codec (i.e. not explicitly tested here):
 *
 * [MQTT-1.5.4-1] The character data in a UTF-8 Encoded String MUST be well-formed UTF-8 as defined by the Unicode specification [Unicode] and restated in RFC 3629 [RFC3629]. In particular, the character data MUST NOT include encodings of code points between U+D800 and U+DFFF.
 * [MQTT-1.5.4-2] A UTF-8 Encoded String MUST NOT include an encoding of the null character U+0000.
 * [MQTT-1.5.4-3] A UTF-8 encoded sequence 0xEF 0xBB 0xBF is always interpreted as U+FEFF ("ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE") wherever it appears in a string and MUST NOT be skipped over or stripped off by a packet receiver.
 * [MQTT-1.5.5-1] The encoded value MUST use the minimum number of bytes necessary to represent the value.
 * [MQTT-1.5.7-1] Both strings MUST comply with the requirements for UTF-8 Encoded Strings.
