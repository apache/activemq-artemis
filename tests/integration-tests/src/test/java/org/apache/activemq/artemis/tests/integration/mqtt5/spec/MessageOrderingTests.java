/**
 * Fulfilled by client or Netty codec (i.e. not tested here):
 *
 * [MQTT-4.6.0-1] When the Client re-sends any PUBLISH packets, it MUST re-send them in the order in which the original PUBLISH packets were sent (this applies to QoS 1 and QoS 2 messages).
 * [MQTT-4.6.0-2] The Client MUST send PUBACK packets in the order in which the corresponding PUBLISH packets were received (QoS 1 messages).
 * [MQTT-4.6.0-3] The Client MUST send PUBREC packets in the order in which the corresponding PUBLISH packets were received (QoS 2 messages).
 * [MQTT-4.6.0-4] The Client MUST send PUBREL packets in the order in which the corresponding PUBREC packets were received (QoS 2 messages).
 *
 *
 * Message order is one of the fundamental semantics of a queue and since subscriptions are queues the messages are therefore ordered implicitly so I'm not testing these here.
 *
 * [MQTT-4.6.0-5] When a Server processes a message that has been published to an Ordered Topic, it MUST send PUBLISH packets to consumers (for the same Topic and QoS) in the order that they were received from any given Client.
 * [MQTT-4.6.0-6] A Server MUST treat every, Topic as an Ordered Topic when it is forwarding messages on Nonâ€‘shared Subscriptions.
