/**
 * Fulfilled by client (i.e. not tested here):
 *
 * [MQTT-6.0.0-1] MQTT Control Packets MUST be sent in WebSocket binary data frames. If any other type of data frame is received the recipient MUST close the Network Connection.
 * [MQTT-6.0.0-3] The Client MUST include “mqtt” in the list of WebSocket Sub Protocols it offers.
 *
 *
 * Fulfilled by the Netty codec on broker (i.e. not explicitly tested here):
 *
 * [MQTT-6.0.0-2] A single WebSocket data frame can contain multiple or partial MQTT Control Packets. The receiver MUST NOT assume that MQTT Control Packets are aligned on WebSocket frame boundaries.
 *
 *
 * This is tested implicitly as almost all tests are run using both TCP and WebSocket connections. The subprotocol is defined in org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.protocol.mqtt.MQTTProtocolManager#websocketRegistryNames:
 *
 * [MQTT-6.0.0-4] The WebSocket Subprotocol name selected and returned by the Server MUST be “mqtt”.
