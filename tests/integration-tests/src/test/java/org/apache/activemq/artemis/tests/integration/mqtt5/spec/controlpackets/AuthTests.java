/**
 * Fulfilled by client or Netty codec (i.e. not tested here):
 *
 * [MQTT-3.15.1-1] Bits 3,2,1 and 0 of the Fixed Header of the AUTH packet are reserved and MUST all be set to 0. The Client or Server MUST treat any other value as malformed and close the Network Connection.
 *
 *
 * The broker doesn't send any "Reason String" or "User Property" in the AUTH packet for any reason. Therefore, these are not tested here:
 *
 * [MQTT-3.15.2-2] The sender MUST NOT send this property if it would increase the size of the AUTH packet beyond the Maximum Packet Size specified by the receiver
 * [MQTT-3.15.2-3] The sender MUST NOT send this property if it would increase the size of the AUTH packet beyond the Maximum Packet Size specified by the receiver.
 *
 *
 * Not implemented.
 *
 * [MQTT-3.15.2-1] The sender of the AUTH Packet MUST use one of the Authenticate Reason Codes.
