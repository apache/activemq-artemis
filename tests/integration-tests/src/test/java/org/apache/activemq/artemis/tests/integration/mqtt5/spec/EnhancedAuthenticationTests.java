/**
 * Fulfilled by client or Netty codec (i.e. not tested here):
 *
 * [MQTT-4.12.0-3] The Client responds to an AUTH packet from the Server by sending a further AUTH packet. This packet MUST contain a Reason Code of 0x18 (Continue authentication).
 * [MQTT-4.12.0-7] If the Client does not include an Authentication Method in the CONNECT, the Client MUST NOT send an AUTH packet to the Server.
 *
 *
 * Not Implemented:
 *
 * [MQTT-4.12.0-2] If the Server requires additional information to complete the authorization, it can send an AUTH packet to the Client. This packet MUST contain a Reason Code of 0x18 (Continue authentication).
 * [MQTT-4.12.0-4] The Server can reject the authentication at any point in this process. It MAY send a CONNACK with a Reason Code of 0x80 or above as described in section 4.13, and MUST close the Network Connection.
 * [MQTT-4.12.0-5] If the initial CONNECT packet included an Authentication Method property then all AUTH packets, and any successful CONNACK packet MUST include an Authentication Method Property with the same value as in the CONNECT packet.
 * [MQTT-4.12.0-6] If the Client does not include an Authentication Method in the CONNECT, the Server MUST NOT send an AUTH packet, and it MUST NOT send an Authentication Method in the CONNACK packet.
 * [MQTT-4.12.1-1] If the Client supplied an Authentication Method in the CONNECT packet it can initiate a re-authentication at any time after receiving a CONNACK. It does this by sending an AUTH packet with a Reason Code of 0x19 (Re-authentication). The Client MUST set the Authentication Method to the same value as the Authentication Method originally used to authenticate the Network Connection.
 * [MQTT-4.12.1-2] If the re-authentication fails, the Client or Server SHOULD send DISCONNECT with an appropriate Reason Code and MUST close the Network Connection.
