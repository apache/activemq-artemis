/**
 * The MQTT 5 specification discusses a "send quota," but this is really an implementation detail and therefore not explicitly tested here:
 *
 * [MQTT-4.9.0-1] The Client or Server MUST set its initial send quota to a non-zero value not exceeding the Receive Maximum.
 * [MQTT-4.9.0-2] Each time the Client or Server sends a PUBLISH packet at QoS > 0, it decrements the send quota. If the send quota reaches zero, the Client or Server MUST NOT send any more PUBLISH packets with QoS > 0.
 *
 *
 * This is tested in org.apache.activemq.artemis.tests.integration.mqtt5.spec.controlpackets.PublishTests#testPacketDelayReceiveMaximum():
 *
 * [MQTT-4.9.0-3] The Client and Server MUST continue to process and respond to all other MQTT Control Packets even if the quota is zero.
