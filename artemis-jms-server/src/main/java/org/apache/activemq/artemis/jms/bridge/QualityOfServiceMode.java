/**
 * <h2>Quality of server (QoS) levels</h2>
 *
 * <h3>QOS_AT_MOST_ONCE</h3>
 *
 * With this QoS mode messages will reach the destination from the source at
 * most once. The messages are consumed from the source and acknowledged before
 * sending to the destination. Therefore there is a possibility that if failure
 * occurs between removing them from the source and them arriving at the
 * destination they could be lost. Hence delivery will occur at most once. This
 * mode is available for both persistent and non persistent messages.
 *
 * <h3>QOS_DUPLICATES_OK</h3>
 *
 * With this QoS mode, the messages are consumed from the source and then
 * acknowledged after they have been successfully sent to the destination.
 * Therefore there is a possibility that if failure occurs after sending to the
 * destination but before acknowledging them, they could be sent again when the
 * system recovers. I.e. the destination might receive duplicates after a
 * failure. This mode is available for both persistent and non persistent
 * messages.
 *
 * <h3>QOS_ONCE_AND_ONLY_ONCE</h3>
 *
 * This QoS mode ensures messages will reach the destination from the source
 * once and only once. (Sometimes this mode is known as "exactly once"). If both
 * the source and the destination are on the same ActiveMQ Artemis server
 * instance then this can be achieved by sending and acknowledging the messages
 * in the same local transaction. If the source and destination are on different
 * servers this is achieved by enlisting the sending and consuming sessions in a
 * JTA transaction. The JTA transaction is controlled by JBoss Transactions JTA
 * implementation which is a fully recovering transaction manager, thus
 * providing a very high degree of durability. If JTA is required then both
 * supplied connection factories need to be XAConnectionFactory implementations.
 * This mode is only available for persistent messages. This is likely to be the
 * slowest mode since it requires extra persistence for the transaction logging.
 *
 * Note: For a specific application it may possible to provide once and only
 * once semantics without using the QOS_ONCE_AND_ONLY_ONCE QoS level. This can
 * be done by using the QOS_DUPLICATES_OK mode and then checking for duplicates
 * at the destination and discarding them. Some JMS servers provide automatic
 * duplicate message detection functionality, or this may be possible to
 * implement on the application level by maintaining a cache of received message
 * ids on disk and comparing received messages to them. The cache would only be
 * valid for a certain period of time so this approach is not as watertight as
 * using QOS_ONCE_AND_ONLY_ONCE but may be a good choice depending on your
 * specific application.
