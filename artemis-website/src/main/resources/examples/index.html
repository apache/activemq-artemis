            <h1>Apache ActiveMQ Artemis Examples</h1>

            <p>Apache ActiveMQ Artemis comes with over 90 runnable examples. These can be found in the examples
                directory in the root of the
                distribution folder. There are examples covering JMS as well as all the protocols and functionality that
                Apache ActiveMQ Artemis
                supports.</p>

            <p>Each example has its own instructions as to how they can be run, but for most of them it is as simple as
                running
                <code>mvn verify</code> from the example directory. This will start a broker with the correct
                configuration, run the
                example and then stop the broker. You'll need to ensure there is not a broker already running as this
                may conflict
                with the broker that is configured and used in the example.</p>

            <p>You may also run the example without starting the server by specifying -PnoServer (mvn -PnoServer
                verify). You can then use your own server for the example.</p>

            <p>Notice that some examples will require special cases and multiple servers, for example in some Failover
                tests. Always refer to the README on each example.</p>
