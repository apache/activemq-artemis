/**
 * UUIDTimer produces the time stamps required for time-based UUIDs. It works as
 * outlined in the UUID specification, with following implementation:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Java classes can only product time stamps with maximum resolution of one
 * millisecond (at least before JDK 1.5). To compensate, an additional counter
 * is used, so that more than one UUID can be generated between java clock
 * updates. Counter may be used to generate up to 10000 UUIDs for each distinct
 * java clock value.
 * <li>Due to even lower clock resolution on some platforms (older Windows
 * versions use 55 msec resolution), timestamp value can also advanced ahead of
 * physical value within limits (by default, up 100 millisecond ahead of
 * reported), iff necessary (ie. 10000 instances created before clock time
 * advances).
 * <li>As an additional precaution, counter is initialized not to 0 but to a
 * random 8-bit number, and each time clock changes, lowest 8-bits of counter
 * are preserved. The purpose it to make likelihood of multi-JVM multi-instance
 * generators to collide, without significantly reducing max. UUID generation
 * speed. Note though that using more than one generator (from separate JVMs) is
 * strongly discouraged, so hopefully this enhancement isn't needed. This 8-bit
 * offset has to be reduced from total max. UUID count to preserve ordering
 * property of UUIDs (ie. one can see which UUID was generated first for given
 * UUID generator); the resulting 9500 UUIDs isn't much different from the
 * optimal choice.
 * <li>Finally, as of version 2.0 and onwards, optional external timestamp
 * synchronization can be done. This is done similar to the way UUID
 * specification suggests; except that since there is no way to lock the whole
 * system, file-based locking is used. This works between multiple JVMs and Jug
 * instances.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Some additional assumptions about calculating the timestamp:
 * <ul>
 * <li>System.currentTimeMillis() is assumed to give time offset in UTC, or at
 * least close enough thing to get correct timestamps. The alternate route would
 * have to go through calendar object, use TimeZone offset to get to UTC, and
 * then modify. Using currentTimeMillis should be much faster to allow rapid
 * UUID creation.
 * <li>Similarly, the constant used for time offset between 1.1.1970 and start
 * of Gregorian calendar is assumed to be correct (which seems to be the case
 * when testing with Java calendars).
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Note about synchronization: this class is assumed to always be called from a
 * synchronized context (caller locks on either this object, or a similar timer
 * lock), and so has no method synchronization.
