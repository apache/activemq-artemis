/** This MessageDecoder is based on LengthFieldBasedFrameDecoder.
 *  When OpenWire clients send a Large Message (large in the context of size only as openwire does not support message chunk streaming).
 *  In that context the server will transfer the huge frame to a Heap Buffer, instead of keeping a really large native buffer.
 *
 *  There's a test showing this situation under ./soak-tests named OWLeakTest. The test will send 200MB messages. For every message sent we would have 200MB native buffers
 *  not leaving much space for the broker to handle its IO as most of the IO needs to be done with Native Memory.
